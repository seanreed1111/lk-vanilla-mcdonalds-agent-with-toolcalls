You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   **For related tickets:**\n   - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n     - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n     - description is a brief kebab-case description\n   - Examples:\n     - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n     - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n   - After making changes, run `humanlayer thoughts sync` again\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n   - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks.

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If a Linear ticket is mentioned, use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   **For related tickets:**\n   - **linear-searcher** - To find similar issues or past implementations\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md` where:\n     - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date\n     - ENG-XXXX is the ticket number (omit if no ticket)\n     - description is a brief kebab-case description\n   - Examples:\n     - With ticket: `2025-01-08-ENG-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`\n     - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-improve-error-handling.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n````markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n````\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-description.md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n   - After making changes, run `humanlayer thoughts sync` again\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n   - automated steps should use `make` whenever possible - for example `make -C humanlayer-wui check` instead of `cd humanlayer-wui && bun run fmt`\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /create_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks.

It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results."],"durationSeconds":13.96047675000003}},{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01A9UKD8XDq8j2e6scC39DXQ","type":"tool_result","content":"Web search results for query: \"Dan North CUPID properties better than SOLID\"\n\nLinks: [{\"title\":\"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech\",\"url\":\"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north\"},{\"title\":\"Why You Should Start Using CUPID and Not SOLID\",\"url\":\"https://dzone.com/articles/why-you-should-start-using-cupid-and-not-solid-to\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited\",\"url\":\"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID vs. SOLID – Mozaic Works\",\"url\":\"https://mozaicworks.com/blog/cupid-vs-solid\"},{\"title\":\"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code\",\"url\":\"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html\"},{\"title\":\"Be more CUPID, be less SOLID - Nogginbox\",\"url\":\"https://www.nogginbox.co.uk/blog/cupid\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article."],"durationSeconds":27.876682875000057}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:39.328Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01GYAYLfxde2FxwyMLkVhXKx","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good, I found the main sources including Dan North's original article and the cupid.dev website.

Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Overview\n\nCUPID is the creation of Dan North, originating as a criticism of the SOLID principles. There are properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with. The more your code has these qualities, the more joyful it is to work with.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\nCUPID: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based:\n\n1. **Composable** - Composable code has classes and functions that are easily combined, assembled in different combinations, to address specific requirements. It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected.

There are properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with. The more your code has these qualities, the more joyful it is to work with.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\nCUPID: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based:\n\n1. **Composable** - Composable code has classes and functions that are easily combined, assembled in different combinations, to address specific requirements. It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article."],"durationSeconds":27.876682875000057}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:39.328Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01GYAYLfxde2FxwyMLkVhXKx","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good, I found the main sources including Dan North's original article and the cupid.dev website.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},"normalizedMessages":[{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:54:40.642Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01PVvUAqETAzkNbALW9j5KJU","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The user wants me to research CUPID software design principles.

The five properties are:\n\n1. **Composable** - Plays well with others, small surface area, intention revealing, minimal dependencies\n2. **Unix philosophy** - Does one thing well with a simple, consistent model\n3. **Predictable** - Does what you expect, behaves as expected, deterministic, observable\n4. **Idiomatic** - Feels familiar even when you haven't seen it before\n5. **Domain-based** - Minimizes cognitive distance from need to solution\n\n### Properties vs. Principles\n\nNorth realized that the idea of principles itself was problematic, as principles are like rules where you're either compliant or not, giving rise to \"bounded sets\" of rule-followers rather than \"centred sets\" of people with shared values - instead focusing on properties as qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow.(no content)North describes these as \"properties of code that make it joyful to work with, that make coding fun.\"\n\n### Criticism of SOLID\n\nAccording to North, the originator of Behaviour-Driven Development, SOLID may even be outdated."],"durationSeconds":15.13608275000006}},{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01A4WUzBvxNd3eKNQQ2pGf5i","type":"tool_result","content":"Web search results for query: \"CUPID principles practical examples code\"\n\nLinks: [{\"title\":\"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code\",\"url\":\"https://cupid.dev/properties/\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech\",\"url\":\"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited\",\"url\":\"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck\",\"url\":\"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding\"},{\"title\":\"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code\",\"url\":\"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html\"},{\"title\":\"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID\",\"url\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan\"},{\"title\":\"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly.

UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:15.208Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_012Qss49ByRNph69JHXavh11","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Great!

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Small Surface Area\nA narrow, focused API reduces cognitive load and minimizes potential conflicts.

UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article."],"durationSeconds":27.876682875000057}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:39.328Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01GYAYLfxde2FxwyMLkVhXKx","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good, I found the main sources including Dan North's original article and the cupid.dev website.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:15.208Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_012Qss49ByRNph69JHXavh11","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Great!

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:15.208Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_012Qss49ByRNph69JHXavh11","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Great!

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article."],"durationSeconds":27.876682875000057}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:39.328Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01GYAYLfxde2FxwyMLkVhXKx","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good, I found the main sources including Dan North's original article and the cupid.dev website.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives."}]},"uuid":"d579a30c-0015-4a68-ba1c-7aac9157fa9b","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:12.864Z","toolUseResult":{"bytes":50114,"code":200,"codeText":"OK","result":"# CUPID: Five Properties for Joyful Coding\n\n## Overview\n\nCUPID replaces rigid principles with flexible properties—characteristics that make code more pleasant to work with.

Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:15.208Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_012Qss49ByRNph69JHXavh11","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Great!

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Small Surface Area\nA narrow, focused API reduces cognitive load and minimizes potential conflicts.

PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:15.208Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_012Qss49ByRNph69JHXavh11","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Great!

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others. Properties define a direction of travel toward a \"center,\" never a finish line—\"done\" never arrives.","durationMs":23572,"url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"}},{"type":"assistant","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:59:15.208Z","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_012Qss49ByRNph69JHXavh11","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Great!

Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Overview\n\nCUPID is the creation of Dan North, originating as a criticism of the SOLID principles. There are properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with. The more your code has these qualities, the more joyful it is to work with.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\nCUPID: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based:\n\n1. **Composable** - Composable code has classes and functions that are easily combined, assembled in different combinations, to address specific requirements. It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient.

There are properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with. The more your code has these qualities, the more joyful it is to work with.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\nCUPID: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based:\n\n1. **Composable** - Composable code has classes and functions that are easily combined, assembled in different combinations, to address specific requirements. It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

Here's what the search revealed:\n\n## Overview\n\nCUPID is the creation of Dan North, originating as a criticism of the SOLID principles. There are properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with. The more your code has these qualities, the more joyful it is to work with.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\nCUPID: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based:\n\n1. **Composable** - Composable code has classes and functions that are easily combined, assembled in different combinations, to address specific requirements. It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient.

There are properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with. The more your code has these qualities, the more joyful it is to work with.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\nCUPID: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based:\n\n1. **Composable** - Composable code has classes and functions that are easily combined, assembled in different combinations, to address specific requirements. It is also intention-revealing, requires minimal dependencies and small surface area.\n\n2. **Unix philosophy** - The Unix philosophy encourages coding components that work well together, each doing one thing and doing it well.\n\n3. **Predictable** - The goal here is code that is robust, reliable, and resilient. It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Core Concept:** Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving.\n\n### Language Idioms\n- Opinionated languages (Go, Python) make assessment straightforward\n- Go uses `gofmt` formatter, eliminating style disagreements; ships \"Effective Go\" guide\n- Flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl) permit multiple approaches\n- TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) in Perl exemplifies the flexibility cost\n- Same problem solvable via iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion—all in one codebase\n- Learning language idioms worth investment since technology outlasts any single project\n\n### Local Idioms\nWhen language offers no consensus, teams establish shared standards:\n- Code formatting rules in IDEs\n- Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n- Unified toolchain agreement\n- Architecture Decision Records document style and idiom choices as \"significant technical decisions\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6832bba8-dda8-4c1a-8ec8-bd05d080934f","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:00:45.346Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"CUPID\" anti-patterns violations code smells examples","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0118a2PeoKwbDt3v4DSQmtuJ","content":[{"title":"Antipattern and Code Smell False Positives:","url":"https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/25394/paper.pdf"},{"title":"Code Smells and Anti-Patterns: Signs You Need to Improve Code Quality","url":"https://blog.codacy.com/code-smells-and-anti-patterns"},{"title":"Code smells and Anti-patterns: How to recognize bad code","url":"https://www.barrage.net/blog/technology/code-smells-and-anti-patterns-how-to-recognize-bad"},{"title":"Anti-Patterns and Code Smells.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

CUPID: A Software Love Story with Dan North\",\"url\":\"https://www.retrotimepodcast.com/27-cupid-a-software-love-story-with-dan-north/\"}]\n\nBased on my search results, I found information about **CUPID**, a set of software design properties created by Daniel Terhorst-North as an alternative to SOLID principles. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6832bba8-dda8-4c1a-8ec8-bd05d080934f","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:00:45.346Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"CUPID\" anti-patterns violations code smells examples","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0118a2PeoKwbDt3v4DSQmtuJ","content":[{"title":"Antipattern and Code Smell False Positives:","url":"https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/25394/paper.pdf"},{"title":"Code Smells and Anti-Patterns: Signs You Need to Improve Code Quality","url":"https://blog.codacy.com/code-smells-and-anti-patterns"},{"title":"Code smells and Anti-patterns: How to recognize bad code","url":"https://www.barrage.net/blog/technology/code-smells-and-anti-patterns-how-to-recognize-bad"},{"title":"Anti-Patterns and Code Smells.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component.

It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6832bba8-dda8-4c1a-8ec8-bd05d080934f","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:00:45.346Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"CUPID\" anti-patterns violations code smells examples","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0118a2PeoKwbDt3v4DSQmtuJ","content":[{"title":"Antipattern and Code Smell False Positives:","url":"https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/25394/paper.pdf"},{"title":"Code Smells and Anti-Patterns: Signs You Need to Improve Code Quality","url":"https://blog.codacy.com/code-smells-and-anti-patterns"},{"title":"Code smells and Anti-patterns: How to recognize bad code","url":"https://www.barrage.net/blog/technology/code-smells-and-anti-patterns-how-to-recognize-bad"},{"title":"Anti-Patterns and Code Smells.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Core Concept:** Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together effectively through clear interfaces.\n\n### Simple, Consistent Model\n- Unix succeeded through elegant design: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Components like `ls`, `grep`, `sed` each solve one problem completely\n- Pipes enable composition: output of one feeds input to next\n- Sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n### Single Purpose vs. Single Responsibility\n\n**Key distinction:** \"Doing one thing well\" is outside-in (how you use code); Single Responsibility Principle is inside-out (code organization).\n\n- SRP mandates separation of content and format concerns, often artificially\n- Real-world changes often affect both simultaneously (new field, data source changes)\n- UI component separation (rendering vs. logic) creates administrative overhead\n- Better approach: let domain-based structure guide separation organically as codebase grows\n- \"One thing well\" produces more natural, cohesive boundaries\n\n---\n\n## 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability.\n\n### Behaves as Expected\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Should pass tests even when none exist—demonstrates well-designed code\n- \"Characterization tests\" document actual system behavior\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n### Deterministic\nThree dimensions of reliability:\n\n- **Robustness:** breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n- **Reliability:** consistent results within covered situations\n- **Resilience:** handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n\nCode should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries.\n\n### Observable\nCode reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense).\n\nFour-stage model (plus bonus stages):\n1. **Instrumentation:** software reporting what it's doing\n2. **Telemetry:** making that information available (pull/push)\n3. **Monitoring:** receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n4. **Alerting:** reacting to monitored patterns\n5. **Predicting:** anticipating events from data\n6. **Adapting:** dynamic system changes based on predictions\n\nMost software stops at instrumentation; deliberate design is superior to runtime system mutations.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information.

Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component.

It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a15bffb1-5b8f-4b3c-b7e8-aaad0e93cb2e","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:22.267Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID software design principles Composable Unix Predictable Idiomatic Domain-based","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012t1qhMCiCXvouYtKPv2YAp","content":[{"title":"SOLID, CUPID, GRASP Principles of Object-Oriented Design | Boldare - Digital Product Development & Design Company","url":"https://www.boldare.com/blog/solid-cupid-grasp-principles-object-oriented-design/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"The 5 CUPID properties for joyful coding | Atekco","url":"https://atekco.io/en/1661224503730-the-5-cupid-properties-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"The CUPID Properties - Code Coach","url":"https://codecoach.biz/the-cupid-properties/"},{"title":"CUPID — FOR JOYFUL CODING","url":"https://medium.com/@Keleno/cupid-for-joyful-coding-a4a95a61f5e8"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID – Domain-driven Design: A Practitioner's Guide","url":"https://ddd-practitioners.com/home/glossary/cupid/"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Retro Time // A Software Podcast // 27.

As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6832bba8-dda8-4c1a-8ec8-bd05d080934f","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:00:45.346Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"CUPID\" anti-patterns violations code smells examples","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0118a2PeoKwbDt3v4DSQmtuJ","content":[{"title":"Antipattern and Code Smell False Positives:","url":"https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/25394/paper.pdf"},{"title":"Code Smells and Anti-Patterns: Signs You Need to Improve Code Quality","url":"https://blog.codacy.com/code-smells-and-anti-patterns"},{"title":"Code smells and Anti-patterns: How to recognize bad code","url":"https://www.barrage.net/blog/technology/code-smells-and-anti-patterns-how-to-recognize-bad"},{"title":"Anti-Patterns and Code Smells.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information.

Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Core Concept:** Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises.

DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Core Concept:** Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution.\n\n### Domain-Based Language\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types: `Surname` instead of `string[30]`; `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n- Prevents subtle bugs (financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: outside observer cannot distinguish code discussion from domain discussion\n- Example: financial analyst discussing trade pricing with programmers, both referencing code line-by-line as domain algorithm\n\n### Domain-Based Structure\nReject framework-imposed directory layouts; instead mirror problem domain:\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Rails popularized this; many frameworks copied the approach\n- Anti-pattern: separating patient records into models, views, controllers across entire codebase\n- Better: top-level folders for `patient_history`, `appointments`, `staffing`, `compliance`\n- Changes to patient records then locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier to navigate for anything beyond trivial modifications\n\n### Domain-Based Boundaries\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Aligns code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid approaches equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents; boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\nThe five properties mutually reinforce:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance from problem to implementation\n\nCode improved along *any* CUPID dimension typically improves others.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6832bba8-dda8-4c1a-8ec8-bd05d080934f","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:00:45.346Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"CUPID\" anti-patterns violations code smells examples","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0118a2PeoKwbDt3v4DSQmtuJ","content":[{"title":"Antipattern and Code Smell False Positives:","url":"https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/25394/paper.pdf"},{"title":"Code Smells and Anti-Patterns: Signs You Need to Improve Code Quality","url":"https://blog.codacy.com/code-smells-and-anti-patterns"},{"title":"Code smells and Anti-patterns: How to recognize bad code","url":"https://www.barrage.net/blog/technology/code-smells-and-anti-patterns-how-to-recognize-bad"},{"title":"Anti-Patterns and Code Smells.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance.

Rather than binary compliance, properties define a center to move toward, allowing incremental improvement.\n\n---\n\n## 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Core Concept:** Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n### Small Surface Area\n- Narrow, opinionated APIs reduce cognitive burden\n- Too-narrow APIs create tacit knowledge barriers; too-broad ones confuse\n- Sweet spot balances fragmentation against bloat\n- Diminishing returns apply—the right granularity is context-dependent\n\n### Intention-Revealing\n- Easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits your need\n- Multi-tiered learning models (2-minute, 10-minute, deep-dive tutorials) enable incremental investment\n- Similar domain terminology naturally surfaces serendipitous discoveries\n- Clear naming acts as documentation\n\n### Minimal Dependencies\n- Reduces version conflicts and incompatibilities\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information.

Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component.

Based on the results, I found that while there are many articles explaining the CUPID properties conceptually, **concrete before/after code examples are relatively scarce** in the available resources.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID is a set of properties or characteristics of software that make it a joy to work with, consisting of five properties that Dan North has chosen:\n\n- **C**omposable - plays well with others\n- **U**nix philosophy - does one thing well  \n- **P**redictable - does what you expect\n- **I**diomatic - feels natural\n- **D**omain-based - in language and structure\n\n## Key Differences from Traditional Principles\n\nCUPID focuses on properties (qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow) that define a goal or centre to move towards, where your code is only closer to or further from the centre.\n\n## Where to Find Code Examples\n\nThe most promising resource I found is:\n\n1. **A guide for senior .NET developers exploring how to evolve from SOLID to CUPID design principles in cloud-native .NET, with idiomatic C# examples and production-ready refactors** (developersvoice.com)\n\n2.

Unlike SOLID's binary \"principles\" (you either comply or don't), CUPID describes **properties**—qualities that code can move toward incrementally. The framework focuses on developer experience and code that is \"joyful\" to work with, emphasizing that properties define a center to move toward rather than rules to follow.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Definition**: Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Small Surface Area**\n- Design narrow, opinionated APIs that reduce cognitive burden\n- Balance between too-narrow (creates tacit knowledge barriers) and too-broad (confuses users)\n- Fewer methods mean less to learn, less to go wrong, less chance of conflicts\n- Apply diminishing returns thinking—the right granularity depends on context\n\n**Intention-Revealing**\n- Enable easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits a need\n- Implement multi-tiered learning models:\n  - 2-minute introduction\n  - 10-minute tutorial\n  - Comprehensive deep dive\n- Use clear, domain-aligned naming that acts as documentation\n- Allow serendipitous discovery through similar terminology\n\n**Minimal Dependencies**\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden and potential version conflicts\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n- Reduce external coupling to lower compatibility concerns\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Can this component be easily combined with others?\n- How many dependencies does it require?\n- Is the API surface area as small as possible while remaining useful?\n- Can someone understand what it does in 2 minutes?\n- Would you describe the API as \"narrow and opinionated\" or \"broad and confusing\"?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Unix command composition: `cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq`\n- Pure functions with minimal dependencies\n- Libraries with zero dependencies for core functionality\n- Single-purpose modules that do one thing extremely well\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- **\"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\"** (Joe Armstrong quote)\n- Large surface areas requiring extensive learning\n- Hidden intentions through unclear naming\n- Excessive framework dependencies\n- Monolithic configurations requiring deep knowledge of internals\n- Tight coupling preventing reuse\n\n---\n\n### 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Definition**: Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together through clear interfaces. This is an **outside-in perspective** (how you use code), not inside-out like Single Responsibility Principle.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Simple, Consistent Model**\n- Follow the Unix elegance: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Each component solves one problem completely\n- Enable composition through clear interfaces (like Unix pipes)\n- Let sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n**Focus on Purpose, Not Organization**\n- \"Doing one thing well\" is about comprehensive external purpose\n- Don't artificially separate concerns that change together\n- Avoid premature optimization and forced separation\n- Let domain-based structure guide separation as codebase grows\n\n#### Key Distinction from Single Responsibility Principle\n\n**SRP (inside-out)**:\n- Focuses on code organization\n- Mandates separation of concerns (e.g., content vs. format)\n- Often creates artificial seams\n- Example: Separating UI rendering from business logic creates \"administrative chores\"\n\n**Unix Philosophy (outside-in)**:\n- Focuses on what something accomplishes from user's viewpoint\n- Allows natural evolution as needs grow\n- Example: `grep` does one thing (pattern matching) completely\n- Real-world changes often affect multiple \"responsibilities\" simultaneously\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Does this component do one thing completely and well?\n- Can its output become input to another component?\n- Is its purpose clear from an outside perspective?\n- Are we separating concerns that actually change together?\n- Does the separation add value or just administrative overhead?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Unix commands: `ls`, `grep`, `sed`, `cat`—each focused and complete\n- Pipeline architecture where output of one feeds input to next\n- Separate data transformation functions (validation, transformation, aggregation)\n- Functions that are focused at the function level, not artificially split\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- God objects doing many unrelated things\n- Over-engineering through premature separation\n- UI components split into rendering/logic when they always change together\n- Separating report content from formatting when both change for new fields\n- Creating separate pipelines for each data consumer instead of reusable stages\n\n---\n\n### 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Definition**: Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability—code should pass tests even when none exist.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Behaves as Expected**\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Design code that would pass tests even if you didn't write them\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Use \"characterization tests\" to document actual system behavior\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n**Deterministic**\n- For given input, always produce same output or effect\n- Define operational boundaries even for non-deterministic code (e.g., random generators)\n- Achieve three dimensions of reliability:\n  - **Robustness**: Breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n  - **Reliability**: Consistent results within covered situations\n  - **Resilience**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n- Code should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries\n\n**Observable**\n- Code reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense)\n- Implement six-stage observability model:\n  1. **Instrumentation**: Software reporting what it's doing\n  2. **Telemetry**: Making information available (pull/push)\n  3. **Monitoring**: Receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n  4. **Alerting**: Reacting to monitored patterns\n  5. **Predicting**: Anticipating events from data\n  6. **Adapting**: Dynamic system changes based on predictions\n- Most software stops at stage 1—aim higher\n- Design observability intentionally rather than relying on runtime mutations\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Would this code pass tests even if we hadn't written them?\n- Does it produce the same output for the same input?\n- Are the edge cases and limitations obvious?\n- Can we infer internal state from outputs?\n- Does it handle unexpected inputs gracefully?\n- Is the code instrumented to reveal its behavior?\n- Under stress conditions, does it behave predictably?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Pure functions with referential transparency\n- Explicit error handling with defined boundaries\n- Comprehensive instrumentation from the outset\n- Idempotent operations that can be retried safely\n- Deterministic behavior with well-defined non-deterministic boundaries\n- Observable internal state through metrics and logs\n- Fast failure when dependencies stall\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Non-deterministic behavior without clear boundaries\n- Hidden side effects\n- Unpredictable failures under stress\n- Non-observable internal state\n- Magic behavior that surprises users\n- Inconsistent results for same inputs\n- Using floats for money amounts (financial software bug)\n- No retry handling or idempotency\n\n---\n\n### 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Definition**: Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving. Code should demonstrate empathy by conforming to established expectations.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Language Idioms**\n- Invest in learning language conventions—technology outlasts any single project\n- For opinionated languages (Go, Python):\n  - Follow established patterns (e.g., `gofmt` for Go)\n  - Reference official guides (\"Effective Go\", \"The Zen of Python\")\n  - Python's principle: \"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\"\n- For flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl):\n  - Choose one approach and be consistent\n  - Avoid mixing paradigms (iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion)\n  - TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) increases cognitive burden\n\n**Local Idioms**\n- When language offers no consensus, establish team standards:\n  - Shared IDE formatting rules\n  - Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n  - Unified toolchain agreement\n  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for style and idiom choices\n- Document significant technical decisions about coding standards\n\n#### Key Principle\n\"Your learning curve for a technology will likely be shorter-lived than any code you write in it.\" Therefore, write code that feels natural to the language/team, not just to you personally.\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Does this code follow language conventions?\n- Would an experienced developer in this language find it natural?\n- Are we mixing multiple paradigms unnecessarily?\n- Do we have documented style guidelines?\n- Is the code using the \"obvious way\" in this language?\n- Does it go with the grain of the framework/platform?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Using `gofmt` in Go to eliminate style disagreements\n- Following \"pythonic\" conventions in Python\n- Consistent paradigm choice (all functional or all OOP, not mixed)\n- Documented local standards via ADRs\n- Code that \"feels familiar even when you haven't seen it before\"\n- Following framework conventions and house style\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Ignoring language-specific conventions\n- Writing Java-style code in Python or vice versa\n- Mixing functional and imperative styles in same codebase\n- Personal preferences that conflict with team/language norms\n- Complex, unnatural code patterns\n- TIMTOWTDI taken to extreme—too many ways to accomplish simple tasks\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort to understand\n\n---\n\n### 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Definition**: Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution. The code and domain discussion should be indistinguishable.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Domain-Based Language**\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types:\n  - Use `Surname` instead of `string[30]`\n  - Use `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n  - Define intention-revealing types specific to your domain\n- Prevents subtle bugs (e.g., financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: \"A casual observer cannot tell whether people are discussing the code or the domain\"\n- Example: Financial analyst and programmer reviewing pricing logic line-by-line using same language\n\n**Domain-Based Structure**\n- Reject framework-imposed directory layouts\n- Mirror problem domain in code organization:\n  - Use domain names: `patient_history/`, `appointments/`, `staffing/`, `compliance/`\n  - NOT technical names: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Changes locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier navigation for non-trivial modifications\n\n**Domain-Based Boundaries**\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Align code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents\n- Boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Can domain experts understand the code structure?\n- Do directory names reflect business concerns or technical frameworks?\n- Would someone overhearing a code discussion think it's about the domain?\n- Are we using domain terminology consistently?\n- Do module boundaries align with domain boundaries?\n- Is related functionality co-located?\n- Are we translating between code terms and business terms?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Top-level folders: `payments/`, `loans/`, `onboarding/`\n- Domain-specific types: `TradePrice`, `PatientRecord`, `Appointment`\n- Code discussions using exact domain terminology\n- Components as business units of deployment\n- Structure that mirrors business organization\n- Co-located related functionality\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Framework-centric organization: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`\n- Scattering patient records across technical layers\n- Using `string[30]` for surnames\n- Using floats for money amounts\n- Generic technical naming disconnected from operations\n- Constant translation between code and business terminology\n- Module boundaries that don't reflect domain boundaries\n- \"Code for the framework, not the solution\"\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\n**Key Insight**: The five properties mutually reinforce each other:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance\n- Code improved along ANY CUPID dimension typically improves others\n\n**Properties define direction of travel toward a \"center\"—there's never a finish line. \"Done\" never arrives.**\n\n---\n\n## How to Evaluate Code Against CUPID\n\n### General Approach\n1. **Properties as a lens**: Use them to assess code quality\n2. **Directional not binary**: Code is closer to or further from each property\n3. **Incremental improvement**: Pick one property to improve, don't require \"all-in\"\n4. **Human-centric**: Focus on developer experience, not just code internals\n5. **Practical assessment**: Easy to articulate, evaluate, and adopt\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n**Composable**:\n- [ ] Small, focused API surface area\n- [ ] Clear, intention-revealing names\n- [ ] Minimal dependencies\n- [ ] Easy to combine with other components\n\n**Unix Philosophy**:\n- [ ] Does one thing completely\n- [ ] Clear external purpose (outside-in)\n- [ ] Can be composed with other components\n- [ ] Avoids artificial separation of concerns\n\n**Predictable**:\n- [ ] Behavior obvious from structure\n- [ ] Deterministic (same input → same output)\n- [ ] Observable (internal state inferable)\n- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully\n\n**Idiomatic**:\n- [ ] Follows language conventions\n- [ ] Uses consistent paradigms\n- [ ] Feels natural to experienced developers\n- [ ] Follows team/project standards\n\n**Domain-Based**:\n- [ ] Uses domain terminology\n- [ ] Structure mirrors problem domain\n- [ ] Boundaries align with domain boundaries\n- [ ] Minimizes translation between code and business\n\n---\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Official CUPID Resources\n- [CUPID: for joyful coding](https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/) -

Resources acknowledge this but don't provide detailed decision frameworks.\n\n4. **Language-specific guidance**: While general principles are clear, language-specific implementations and patterns are still being developed by the community.\n\n5. **Measurement challenges**: Unlike SOLID (which has some measurable proxies), CUPID properties are more subjective and require human judgment about \"joy\" and \"naturalness.\""},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: af6de88 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"e79d7a8d-9f5e-4b3e-86ae-df08a2fcf12b","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:02:52.062Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Research CUPID software design principles in detail.

This is an **outside-in perspective** (how you use code), not inside-out like Single Responsibility Principle.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Simple, Consistent Model**\n- Follow the Unix elegance: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Each component solves one problem completely\n- Enable composition through clear interfaces (like Unix pipes)\n- Let sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n**Focus on Purpose, Not Organization**\n- \"Doing one thing well\" is about comprehensive external purpose\n- Don't artificially separate concerns that change together\n- Avoid premature optimization and forced separation\n- Let domain-based structure guide separation as codebase grows\n\n#### Key Distinction from Single Responsibility Principle\n\n**SRP (inside-out)**:\n- Focuses on code organization\n- Mandates separation of concerns (e.g., content vs. format)\n- Often creates artificial seams\n- Example: Separating UI rendering from business logic creates \"administrative chores\"\n\n**Unix Philosophy (outside-in)**:\n- Focuses on what something accomplishes from user's viewpoint\n- Allows natural evolution as needs grow\n- Example: `grep` does one thing (pattern matching) completely\n- Real-world changes often affect multiple \"responsibilities\" simultaneously\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Does this component do one thing completely and well?\n- Can its output become input to another component?\n- Is its purpose clear from an outside perspective?\n- Are we separating concerns that actually change together?\n- Does the separation add value or just administrative overhead?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Unix commands: `ls`, `grep`, `sed`, `cat`—each focused and complete\n- Pipeline architecture where output of one feeds input to next\n- Separate data transformation functions (validation, transformation, aggregation)\n- Functions that are focused at the function level, not artificially split\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- God objects doing many unrelated things\n- Over-engineering through premature separation\n- UI components split into rendering/logic when they always change together\n- Separating report content from formatting when both change for new fields\n- Creating separate pipelines for each data consumer instead of reusable stages\n\n---\n\n### 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Definition**: Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability—code should pass tests even when none exist.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Behaves as Expected**\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Design code that would pass tests even if you didn't write them\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Use \"characterization tests\" to document actual system behavior\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n**Deterministic**\n- For given input, always produce same output or effect\n- Define operational boundaries even for non-deterministic code (e.g., random generators)\n- Achieve three dimensions of reliability:\n  - **Robustness**: Breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n  - **Reliability**: Consistent results within covered situations\n  - **Resilience**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n- Code should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries\n\n**Observable**\n- Code reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense)\n- Implement six-stage observability model:\n  1. **Instrumentation**: Software reporting what it's doing\n  2. **Telemetry**: Making information available (pull/push)\n  3. **Monitoring**: Receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n  4. **Alerting**: Reacting to monitored patterns\n  5. **Predicting**: Anticipating events from data\n  6. **Adapting**: Dynamic system changes based on predictions\n- Most software stops at stage 1—aim higher\n- Design observability intentionally rather than relying on runtime mutations\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Would this code pass tests even if we hadn't written them?\n- Does it produce the same output for the same input?\n- Are the edge cases and limitations obvious?\n- Can we infer internal state from outputs?\n- Does it handle unexpected inputs gracefully?\n- Is the code instrumented to reveal its behavior?\n- Under stress conditions, does it behave predictably?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Pure functions with referential transparency\n- Explicit error handling with defined boundaries\n- Comprehensive instrumentation from the outset\n- Idempotent operations that can be retried safely\n- Deterministic behavior with well-defined non-deterministic boundaries\n- Observable internal state through metrics and logs\n- Fast failure when dependencies stall\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Non-deterministic behavior without clear boundaries\n- Hidden side effects\n- Unpredictable failures under stress\n- Non-observable internal state\n- Magic behavior that surprises users\n- Inconsistent results for same inputs\n- Using floats for money amounts (financial software bug)\n- No retry handling or idempotency\n\n---\n\n### 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Definition**: Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving. Code should demonstrate empathy by conforming to established expectations.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Language Idioms**\n- Invest in learning language conventions—technology outlasts any single project\n- For opinionated languages (Go, Python):\n  - Follow established patterns (e.g., `gofmt` for Go)\n  - Reference official guides (\"Effective Go\", \"The Zen of Python\")\n  - Python's principle: \"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\"\n- For flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl):\n  - Choose one approach and be consistent\n  - Avoid mixing paradigms (iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion)\n  - TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) increases cognitive burden\n\n**Local Idioms**\n- When language offers no consensus, establish team standards:\n  - Shared IDE formatting rules\n  - Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n  - Unified toolchain agreement\n  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for style and idiom choices\n- Document significant technical decisions about coding standards\n\n#### Key Principle\n\"Your learning curve for a technology will likely be shorter-lived than any code you write in it.\" Therefore, write code that feels natural to the language/team, not just to you personally.\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Does this code follow language conventions?\n- Would an experienced developer in this language find it natural?\n- Are we mixing multiple paradigms unnecessarily?\n- Do we have documented style guidelines?\n- Is the code using the \"obvious way\" in this language?\n- Does it go with the grain of the framework/platform?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Using `gofmt` in Go to eliminate style disagreements\n- Following \"pythonic\" conventions in Python\n- Consistent paradigm choice (all functional or all OOP, not mixed)\n- Documented local standards via ADRs\n- Code that \"feels familiar even when you haven't seen it before\"\n- Following framework conventions and house style\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Ignoring language-specific conventions\n- Writing Java-style code in Python or vice versa\n- Mixing functional and imperative styles in same codebase\n- Personal preferences that conflict with team/language norms\n- Complex, unnatural code patterns\n- TIMTOWTDI taken to extreme—too many ways to accomplish simple tasks\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort to understand\n\n---\n\n### 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Definition**: Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution. The code and domain discussion should be indistinguishable.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Domain-Based Language**\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types:\n  - Use `Surname` instead of `string[30]`\n  - Use `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n  - Define intention-revealing types specific to your domain\n- Prevents subtle bugs (e.g., financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: \"A casual observer cannot tell whether people are discussing the code or the domain\"\n- Example: Financial analyst and programmer reviewing pricing logic line-by-line using same language\n\n**Domain-Based Structure**\n- Reject framework-imposed directory layouts\n- Mirror problem domain in code organization:\n  - Use domain names: `patient_history/`, `appointments/`, `staffing/`, `compliance/`\n  - NOT technical names: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Changes locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier navigation for non-trivial modifications\n\n**Domain-Based Boundaries**\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Align code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents\n- Boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Can domain experts understand the code structure?\n- Do directory names reflect business concerns or technical frameworks?\n- Would someone overhearing a code discussion think it's about the domain?\n- Are we using domain terminology consistently?\n- Do module boundaries align with domain boundaries?\n- Is related functionality co-located?\n- Are we translating between code terms and business terms?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Top-level folders: `payments/`, `loans/`, `onboarding/`\n- Domain-specific types: `TradePrice`, `PatientRecord`, `Appointment`\n- Code discussions using exact domain terminology\n- Components as business units of deployment\n- Structure that mirrors business organization\n- Co-located related functionality\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Framework-centric organization: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`\n- Scattering patient records across technical layers\n- Using `string[30]` for surnames\n- Using floats for money amounts\n- Generic technical naming disconnected from operations\n- Constant translation between code and business terminology\n- Module boundaries that don't reflect domain boundaries\n- \"Code for the framework, not the solution\"\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\n**Key Insight**: The five properties mutually reinforce each other:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance\n- Code improved along ANY CUPID dimension typically improves others\n\n**Properties define direction of travel toward a \"center\"—there's never a finish line. \"Done\" never arrives.**\n\n---\n\n## How to Evaluate Code Against CUPID\n\n### General Approach\n1. **Properties as a lens**: Use them to assess code quality\n2. **Directional not binary**: Code is closer to or further from each property\n3. **Incremental improvement**: Pick one property to improve, don't require \"all-in\"\n4. **Human-centric**: Focus on developer experience, not just code internals\n5. **Practical assessment**: Easy to articulate, evaluate, and adopt\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n**Composable**:\n- [ ] Small, focused API surface area\n- [ ] Clear, intention-revealing names\n- [ ] Minimal dependencies\n- [ ] Easy to combine with other components\n\n**Unix Philosophy**:\n- [ ] Does one thing completely\n- [ ] Clear external purpose (outside-in)\n- [ ] Can be composed with other components\n- [ ] Avoids artificial separation of concerns\n\n**Predictable**:\n- [ ] Behavior obvious from structure\n- [ ] Deterministic (same input → same output)\n- [ ] Observable (internal state inferable)\n- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully\n\n**Idiomatic**:\n- [ ] Follows language conventions\n- [ ] Uses consistent paradigms\n- [ ] Feels natural to experienced developers\n- [ ] Follows team/project standards\n\n**Domain-Based**:\n- [ ] Uses domain terminology\n- [ ] Structure mirrors problem domain\n- [ ] Boundaries align with domain boundaries\n- [ ] Minimizes translation between code and business\n\n---\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Official CUPID Resources\n- [CUPID: for joyful coding](https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/) -

Comprehensive before/after refactoring examples are scarce in current literature.\n\n2. **Emerging framework**: Dan North introduced CUPID relatively recently, and the community is still developing detailed practical applications and tooling.\n\n3. **Context-dependent trade-offs**: The \"right\" balance for each property depends heavily on context. Resources acknowledge this but don't provide detailed decision frameworks.\n\n4. **Language-specific guidance**: While general principles are clear, language-specific implementations and patterns are still being developed by the community.\n\n5. **Measurement challenges**: Unlike SOLID (which has some measurable proxies), CUPID properties are more subjective and require human judgment about \"joy\" and \"naturalness.\""}],"totalDurationMs":493480,"totalTokens":29521,"totalToolUseCount":20,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2730,"cache_read_input_tokens":26776,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2730,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d00f2ff8-3ba4-432e-9a7e-bd37cfdae541"}

Be composable with existing workflow commands\n\nKey commands to create:\n1. `/cupid_review` - Review code against CUPID properties\n2. `/tdd_cycle` - Guide through Red-Green-Refactor\n3. `/cupid_tdd` - Combined workflow for new features\n\nI should also potentially update CLAUDE.md or create a general guidance file that can be referenced.\n\nLet me write the plan now.","signature":"EsgJCkYICxgCKkDi43SJeNy2f3EmvK4QwoqV1L2qeqH0ClGhOQ1WqqqtmlfL+u4Oy9NtSj6a3D/hT5Qy4y4DoUN/sFDTKxW91KsBEgxkzgSqdAzmGQckXTIaDHUMxxyex8aXOcZ8xCIwqWczY/Ydx3+DVBIBuUfaSiae/AW8bByro8yWm77jafacpugTt2ZoICDP9GuEjCFyKq8IKUqfHglHl+iOVy9Z0f2XiMXRSWwhv5NVEUycSDbWc6bqK7XCxej+bOPwaFkyiKfV+MXdsJaTtCsIdeximf/zgkvvRt+x0gRsX0VvTjjObB4KmO6tRr5W9S/SVeyUjvVoFkhbInhz8WgnS4o4Qh07pXGFG9eQz51gWd3/BtESGRERxsaTO9nYiwkekpDYIM51UmjtSX/xuUzhkXVziDOWV+mXIATiCRgscQ1xTEe0RK2Na7wPSOBUAAGDE0t8XHQW+HuB+OlJeTZwKOrHKksng7TnVAx6V75J8ctuFNmYp7w7ragWMAGg24m8TfGOE/IDAE6g1Eg+3ibnyz/LfPqSYtlxU3uHiDOM4AXyUwGfd9QMZU0lC1v8WkF/5qP2wXUWad0zxaxS7DafiwJQ50HWAm9PFusBwKONc80wuvWni6qrs9nYAnkX2nK8J0+s9kMLfYWJr4q1QROtNi/wcHmI/fLXdT9THFNyaJeM/WQ1lzsxJcbB9SEE/6+2V3od2Z7LEmNH+G8lpGf3mGDgG/iKgAxPaUMBGlxGg3fsXH46s9L0JYLnLaE7H7ObGrf13UICuhMPuJt+RuE4UbpBijj37YPf61m0PsnHuCZZlAFKokwcaQ6NOUoiDY8rMPOP14FMDqj8U61EqNR7mKuXpdVid2RqMZiSVEdRtvg0FFZOQu7CaKTPDfe9QxA6HuEVR0lySj0XWvQ7Lx9u75gWG0f9Tg455SwovPjr/CHw+hzRrMoPUYKpOGzglISSLMUPjEkjywRXpu02ZTjY64zZM+gq73IK2wvcRHZYkI5WWixzKv5LVvptNrXbmpY8atiabCsjLnQLTq/0nsI/51noe/DiAaZBfQiNAJ5jT2kCweIiXSanJe5Mgg/kCyYinjMtYxH9Svn/VZO45EAyNbEHrBQzGfvUcMEyEICNctDyFY7s/rjxEXFrdOM/LQJ1WSOYbb25gJu4ZGf5X045cY8GL/aFbr9iYIxVVzYyPAfAEEoILs1mnfLHMf8FOQEVINtJmYcm5azvehXjbuDqx8nyuXz6GdyiofHraY/mfrPbxoZqS5zFZGGF+Kr6RkmcAAPYnNDG4uNsWfZMwh5XwTQx2i0fCktmxJRXNWVcq+9bJ8iUlVPP4P+7zHNZCvf4wi72liyYNkLkHHUnEqfxwaikoRlU6RbPyOczId9w8w5i/jcEkVhC8t1p2wRI5SdaergyqxHYoB8XuMQrPonQ6cR8ISj/oW5ELCvze72nUVymR5uiT0MC4okUyQUhMWUvXh2j6xO6aY54p69MSHY+eM74obNP3akRC+3Zm7NQI+4v4oKyKZgaQtuaSbzn6lnUQc0fz/VBNjcPdsYjFB9BGpSfzhbLmgI3tsGeZqisf47vUW2XONwb9nBvEXcxpswcjNxIdskZ3fx8Eii+0pg9504N0dpsGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":13,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3321,"cache_read_input_tokens":41768,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3321,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXFbhNp9xLi1dcfLyPhgm","type":"assistant","uuid":"9fb54149-1fed-4f69-bdd8-3dcf4318422e","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:03:09.357Z"}

This framework will be general-purpose, working across any project, and will provide guidance principles rather than strict enforcement.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Repository Structure:**\n- 27 custom commands in `.claude/commands/` that implement workflow patterns\n- 6 specialized agents in `.claude/agents/` for codebase exploration\n- Commands follow a consistent pattern: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions\n- Current commands focus on workflow (planning, implementing, validating, git operations)\n- No existing commands specifically guide code quality principles or TDD practices\n- CLAUDE.md provides repository-level guidance but doesn't include code quality frameworks\n\n**CUPID Principles (researched):**\n- **C**omposable: Plays well with others (small surface area, minimal dependencies)\n- **U**nix philosophy: Does one thing well (outside-in perspective)\n- **P**redictable: Does what you expect (deterministic, observable, robust)\n- **I**diomatic: Feels natural (follows language and team conventions)\n- **D**omain-based: Solution models problem domain (language, structure, boundaries)\n\n**TDD Rhythm:**\n- Red: Write failing test first\n- Green: Write minimal code to pass\n- Refactor: Improve code while keeping tests green\n\n## Desired End State\n\n### Specification\n\nA complete CUPID+TDD framework consisting of:\n\n1. **Three new custom commands** in `.claude/commands/`:\n   - `cupid_review.md` - Review code against CUPID properties\n   - `tdd_cycle.md` - Guide through Red-Green-Refactor workflow\n   - `cupid_tdd.md` - Combined workflow for feature development\n\n2. **Reference documentation** in `.claude/reference/`:\n   - `cupid_principles.md` - Detailed CUPID evaluation criteria\n   - `tdd_patterns.md` - Language-specific TDD patterns and examples\n\n3. **Optional CLAUDE.md enhancement** - Integration points for existing workflows\n\n### Verification Criteria\n\n**Automated Verification:**\n- [ ] All command files have valid YAML frontmatter\n- [ ] Command files follow existing naming conventions\n- [ ] Reference directory structure exists\n- [ ] All markdown files are valid: `make lint` (if available)\n- [ ] Commands can be invoked without errors: `/cupid_review`, `/tdd_cycle`, `/cupid_tdd`\n\n**Manual Verification:**\n- [ ] Commands provide helpful, actionable guidance when invoked\n- [ ] CUPID review accurately identifies code quality issues\n- [ ] TDD cycle guides through Red-Green-Refactor naturally\n- [ ] Framework works across different programming languages\n- [ ] Guidance feels like coaching, not enforcement\n- [ ] Commands integrate smoothly with existing workflow\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT creating strict linting rules or automated enforcement\n- NOT building language-specific tooling or parsers\n- NOT modifying existing commands (can reference them though)\n- NOT creating a rigid \"must follow\" checklist system\n- NOT integrating with external tools or services\n- NOT building test runners or test frameworks\n- NOT creating project-specific configurations (keep it general)\n- NOT replacing existing code review processes\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n1. **Create reference documentation first** - Establish CUPID evaluation criteria and TDD patterns as foundation\n2. **Build commands incrementally** - Start with review, then TDD cycle, then combined workflow\n3. **Test each command in isolation** - Validate they provide helpful guidance\n4. **Iterate based on real usage** - Refine based on how well they guide behavior\n\n### Design Principles for Commands\n\n- **Conversational coaching tone** - Guide rather than dictate\n- **Context-aware** - Understand language/framework constraints\n- **Practical over perfect** - Incremental improvement, not binary compliance\n- **Question-driven** - Help Claude ask the right questions\n- **Pattern-based** - Provide concrete examples and anti-patterns\n- **Integration-friendly** - Work with existing workflow commands\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation - Reference Documentation\n\n### Overview\nCreate comprehensive reference documentation that commands will reference. This establishes the knowledge base for CUPID principles and TDD patterns.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Create Reference Directory Structure\n**New Directory**: `.claude/reference/`\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p .claude/reference\n```\n\n#### 2. CUPID Principles Reference\n**File**: `.claude/reference/cupid_principles.md`\n\n**Content Structure**:\n- Introduction to CUPID as properties (not binary rules)\n- Detailed breakdown of each principle with:\n  - Definition and purpose\n  - Evaluation questions\n  - Good patterns with examples\n  - Anti-patterns with examples\n  - Language-specific considerations\n- Code review checklist format\n- Integration with common frameworks\n\n**Key sections**:\n```markdown\n# CUPID Software Design Principles\n\n## Using This Reference\n[How to apply CUPID as guidance, not rules]\n\n## Composable: Plays Well With Others\n### Evaluation Questions\n- [ ] Small API surface area?\n- [ ] Intention-revealing names?\n- [ ] Minimal dependencies?\n[... detailed guidance ...]\n\n## Unix Philosophy: Does One Thing Well\n[... similar structure for each principle ...]\n```\n\n#### 3. TDD Patterns Reference\n**File**: `.claude/reference/tdd_patterns.md`\n\n**Content Structure**:\n- TDD fundamentals (Red-Green-Refactor)\n- Language-specific patterns:\n  - Python (pytest, unittest)\n  - JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest, Vitest)\n  - Go (testing package)\n  - Java (JUnit)\n  - Ruby (RSpec)\n- Test organization patterns\n- Common TDD anti-patterns\n- Integration with CUPID principles\n\n**Key sections**:\n```markdown\n# Test-Driven Development Patterns\n\n## The TDD Cycle\n### Red: Write Failing Test\n### Green: Minimal Implementation\n### Refactor: Improve Design\n\n## Language-Specific Patterns\n### Python\n[pytest examples, unittest patterns]\n\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\n[Jest patterns, Vitest examples]\n\n[... etc ...]\n\n## TDD + CUPID Integration\n[How TDD supports CUPID properties]\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Reference directory exists: `test -d .claude/reference`\n- [ ] CUPID reference file exists: `test -f .claude/reference/cupid_principles.md`\n- [ ] TDD reference file exists: `test -f .claude/reference/tdd_patterns.md`\n- [ ] Markdown is valid (if linter available): `markdownlint .claude/reference/`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] CUPID reference is comprehensive and actionable\n- [ ] TDD patterns cover major languages\n- [ ] Examples are clear and practical\n- [ ] Anti-patterns help identify common mistakes\n- [ ] References support non-expert developers\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual review of the reference content quality before proceeding to Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: CUPID Review Command\n\n### Overview\nCreate `/cupid_review` command that guides Claude to review code against CUPID principles. This provides thoughtful analysis and suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. CUPID Review Command\n**File**: `.claude/commands/cupid_review.md`\n\n**Structure**:\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Review code against CUPID principles for joyful coding\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# CUPID Code Review\n\nYou are tasked with reviewing code using the CUPID software design properties...\n\n## When Invoked\n\n1. **Understand the context**:\n   - What code should be reviewed? (file path, recent changes, specific feature)\n   - If not specified, ask the user\n   - If reviewing git changes, run `git diff` or `git diff HEAD~N`\n\n2. **Read the code fully**:\n   - Use Read tool to examine files completely\n   - Understand the purpose and context\n   - Identify the language and framework\n\n3. **Load CUPID reference**:\n   - Read `.claude/reference/cupid_principles.md` for evaluation criteria\n   - Understand what \"good\" looks like for this language\n\n## Review Process\n\n### Step 1: Initial Assessment\n[Understand code purpose, identify patterns...]\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Against Each Property\n[Structured evaluation with examples...]\n\n### Step 3: Provide Actionable Feedback\n[Prioritized suggestions, not overwhelming...]\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide review in this structure:\n- Summary (2-3 sentences)\n- Property-by-property analysis\n- Strengths identified\n- Improvement opportunities (prioritized)\n- Suggested refactorings (with examples)\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- Focus on helping, not criticizing\n- Acknowledge constraints and trade-offs\n- Provide concrete examples\n- Suggest incremental improvements\n- Consider context (prototype vs production)\n- Respect existing patterns\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Command file exists: `test -f .claude/commands/cupid_review.md`\n- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid\n- [ ] References cupid_principles.md correctly\n- [ ] Command can be invoked: invoke `/cupid_review` without errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Command provides thoughtful, actionable code review\n- [ ] Feedback is balanced (strengths + improvements)\n- [ ] Suggestions include concrete examples\n- [ ] Review adapts to different languages\n- [ ] Tone is coaching, not prescriptive\n- [ ] Works on both new code and refactoring\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, test the command on sample code from different languages before proceeding to Phase 3.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: TDD Cycle Command\n\n### Overview\nCreate `/tdd_cycle` command that guides Claude through Test-Driven Development workflow. This helps maintain the Red-Green-Refactor rhythm.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. TDD Cycle Command\n**File**: `.claude/commands/tdd_cycle.md`\n\n**Structure**:\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Guide through Test-Driven Development Red-Green-Refactor cycle\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# TDD Cycle\n\nYou are tasked with guiding Test-Driven Development following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle...\n\n## When Invoked\n\n1. **Determine starting point**:\n   - Are we starting fresh (write first test)?\n   - Are we at Red (test failing, need implementation)?\n   - Are we at Green (tests pass, ready to refactor)?\n   - If unclear, ask user where we are in the cycle\n\n2. **Understand what we're building**:\n   - What functionality is being added/changed?\n   - What behavior should the test verify?\n   - What are the edge cases?\n\n3. **Load TDD patterns**:\n   - Read `.claude/reference/tdd_patterns.md`\n   - Identify language-specific patterns\n   - Find relevant examples\n\n## The TDD Cycle\n\n### Red: Write Failing Test\n\n**Process**:\n1. Understand the requirement clearly\n2. Write a focused test for ONE behavior\n3. Run the test and verify it fails appropriately\n4. Explain what the test verifies\n\n**Guidelines**:\n- Start with simplest case\n- Test one thing at a time\n- Use descriptive test names\n- Ensure test fails for the right reason\n\n### Green: Minimal Implementation\n\n**Process**:\n1. Write simplest code to pass the test\n2. No gold-plating or premature optimization\n3. Run tests to verify they pass\n4.

This framework will be general-purpose, working across any project, and will provide guidance principles rather than strict enforcement.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Repository Structure:**\n- 27 custom commands in `.claude/commands/` that implement workflow patterns\n- 6 specialized agents in `.claude/agents/` for codebase exploration\n- Commands follow a consistent pattern: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions\n- Current commands focus on workflow (planning, implementing, validating, git operations)\n- No existing commands specifically guide code quality principles or TDD practices\n- CLAUDE.md provides repository-level guidance but doesn't include code quality frameworks\n\n**CUPID Principles (researched):**\n- **C**omposable: Plays well with others (small surface area, minimal dependencies)\n- **U**nix philosophy: Does one thing well (outside-in perspective)\n- **P**redictable: Does what you expect (deterministic, observable, robust)\n- **I**diomatic: Feels natural (follows language and team conventions)\n- **D**omain-based: Solution models problem domain (language, structure, boundaries)\n\n**TDD Rhythm:**\n- Red: Write failing test first\n- Green: Write minimal code to pass\n- Refactor: Improve code while keeping tests green\n\n## Desired End State\n\n### Specification\n\nA complete CUPID+TDD framework consisting of:\n\n1. **Three new custom commands** in `.claude/commands/`:\n   - `cupid_review.md` - Review code against CUPID properties\n   - `tdd_cycle.md` - Guide through Red-Green-Refactor workflow\n   - `cupid_tdd.md` - Combined workflow for feature development\n\n2. **Reference documentation** in `.claude/reference/`:\n   - `cupid_principles.md` - Detailed CUPID evaluation criteria\n   - `tdd_patterns.md` - Language-specific TDD patterns and examples\n\n3. **Optional CLAUDE.md enhancement** - Integration points for existing workflows\n\n### Verification Criteria\n\n**Automated Verification:**\n- [ ] All command files have valid YAML frontmatter\n- [ ] Command files follow existing naming conventions\n- [ ] Reference directory structure exists\n- [ ] All markdown files are valid: `make lint` (if available)\n- [ ] Commands can be invoked without errors: `/cupid_review`, `/tdd_cycle`, `/cupid_tdd`\n\n**Manual Verification:**\n- [ ] Commands provide helpful, actionable guidance when invoked\n- [ ] CUPID review accurately identifies code quality issues\n- [ ] TDD cycle guides through Red-Green-Refactor naturally\n- [ ] Framework works across different programming languages\n- [ ] Guidance feels like coaching, not enforcement\n- [ ] Commands integrate smoothly with existing workflow\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT creating strict linting rules or automated enforcement\n- NOT building language-specific tooling or parsers\n- NOT modifying existing commands (can reference them though)\n- NOT creating a rigid \"must follow\" checklist system\n- NOT integrating with external tools or services\n- NOT building test runners or test frameworks\n- NOT creating project-specific configurations (keep it general)\n- NOT replacing existing code review processes\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### High-Level Strategy\n\n1. **Create reference documentation first** - Establish CUPID evaluation criteria and TDD patterns as foundation\n2. **Build commands incrementally** - Start with review, then TDD cycle, then combined workflow\n3. **Test each command in isolation** - Validate they provide helpful guidance\n4. **Iterate based on real usage** - Refine based on how well they guide behavior\n\n### Design Principles for Commands\n\n- **Conversational coaching tone** - Guide rather than dictate\n- **Context-aware** - Understand language/framework constraints\n- **Practical over perfect** - Incremental improvement, not binary compliance\n- **Question-driven** - Help Claude ask the right questions\n- **Pattern-based** - Provide concrete examples and anti-patterns\n- **Integration-friendly** - Work with existing workflow commands\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation - Reference Documentation\n\n### Overview\nCreate comprehensive reference documentation that commands will reference. This establishes the knowledge base for CUPID principles and TDD patterns.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1.

Combined Workflow Command\n**File**: `.claude/commands/cupid_tdd.md`\n\n**Structure**:\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Feature development with TDD rhythm and CUPID principles\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# CUPID + TDD Feature Development\n\nYou are tasked with developing features using Test-Driven Development while applying CUPID design principles...\n\n## When Invoked\n\n1. **Understand the feature**:\n   - What are we building?\n   - What problem does it solve?\n   - What are the requirements and constraints?\n\n2. **Plan the approach**:\n   - Break down into testable behaviors\n   - Identify CUPID considerations upfront\n   - Consider domain alignment\n   - Plan test structure\n\n3. **Load references**:\n   - Read both `.claude/reference/cupid_principles.md` and `tdd_patterns.md`\n   - Understand language-specific patterns\n   - Identify relevant examples\n\n## Development Process\n\n### Phase 1: Design with CUPID in Mind\n\nBefore writing code:\n- **Composable**: How will this integrate?\n- **Unix Philosophy**: What's the one thing this does?\n- **Predictable**: What are the inputs/outputs?\n- **Idiomatic**: What patterns does this codebase use?\n- **Domain-Based**: What domain concepts are involved?\n\nPresent design approach to user for alignment.\n\n### Phase 2: TDD Implementation\n\nFor each behavior to implement:\n\n1. **Red**: Write focused test\n   - Consider CUPID: Is test name domain-based?\n   - Consider CUPID: Is test predictable and clear?\n\n2. **Green**: Minimal implementation\n   - Keep it simple\n   - Make it work\n\n3. **Refactor**: Apply CUPID\n   - **Composable**: Small, focused functions?\n   - **Unix Philosophy**: Does one thing well?\n   - **Predictable**: Clear behavior?\n   - **Idiomatic**: Follows conventions?\n   - **Domain-Based**: Uses domain language?\n\nRun tests after each refactoring step.\n\n### Phase 3: Integration Review\n\nAfter implementation:\n- Review complete implementation against CUPID\n- Identify integration points\n- Consider edge cases\n- Verify tests are comprehensive\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\nThis command can work with existing commands:\n- Use after `/create_plan` to implement planned features\n- Can feed into `/validate_plan` for verification\n- Followed by `/cupid_review` for final review\n- Then `/commit` for clean git history\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- Don't let CUPID slow down TDD momentum\n- Apply principles during refactor phase primarily\n- Stay pragmatic - not every line needs perfect CUPID compliance\n- Use CUPID to guide design decisions, not as rigid rules\n- Keep tests fast and focused\n- Maintain green tests throughout\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Command file exists: `test -f .claude/commands/cupid_tdd.md`\n- [ ] YAML frontmatter is valid\n- [ ] References both reference documents\n- [ ] Command can be invoked: invoke `/cupid_tdd` without errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Command provides smooth, integrated workflow\n- [ ] TDD rhythm is maintained throughout\n- [ ] CUPID principles are applied thoughtfully, not rigidly\n- [ ] Works well for greenfield features\n- [ ] Adapts to refactoring existing code\n- [ ] Integrates with existing workflow commands\n- [ ] Produces high-quality, well-tested code\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, test the command by building a complete feature including tests, refactoring, and integration.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: Integration and Documentation\n\n### Overview\nOptionally enhance CLAUDE.md with framework overview and create usage examples. Make the framework discoverable and easy to adopt.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Optional CLAUDE.md Enhancement\n**File**: `CLAUDE.md`\n\nAdd section to existing file:\n\n```markdown\n## Code Quality Framework: CUPID + TDD\n\nThis repository includes commands for applying CUPID design principles and Test-Driven Development:\n\n### Commands\n\n```bash\n/cupid_review          # Review code against CUPID properties\n/tdd_cycle            # Guide through Red-Green-Refactor\n/cupid_tdd            # Complete feature development workflow\n```\n\n### Reference Documentation\n\n- `.claude/reference/cupid_principles.md` - CUPID evaluation criteria\n- `.claude/reference/tdd_patterns.md` - Language-specific TDD patterns\n\n### Usage Patterns\n\n**Code Review**:\n```bash\n/cupid_review path/to/file.py\n/cupid_review  # Reviews recent git changes\n```\n\n**TDD Development**:\n```bash\n/tdd_cycle  # Guides through current cycle phase\n```\n\n**Full Feature Development**:\n```bash\n/cupid_tdd  # Combined workflow\n```\n\n### Integration with Existing Workflow\n\nThe quality commands integrate seamlessly:\n1. `/create_plan` - Plan the feature\n2. `/cupid_tdd` - Implement with TDD and CUPID\n3. `/validate_plan` - Verify implementation\n4. `/cupid_review` - Final quality check\n5. `/commit` - Create clean commits\n6. `/describe_pr` - Generate PR description\n\n### Philosophy\n\nCUPID principles are **properties to move toward**, not binary rules. The framework provides guidance and coaching, helping agents write joyful, maintainable code while staying pragmatic.\n```\n\n#### 2. Create Usage Examples\n**File**: `.claude/reference/cupid_tdd_examples.md`\n\n**Content**:\n- Complete worked examples in 3-4 languages\n- Before/after refactoring examples\n- Common scenarios (API endpoint, data processing, UI component)\n- Integration with existing commands\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md syntax is valid markdown\n- [ ] Example file exists: `test -f .claude/reference/cupid_tdd_examples.md`\n- [ ] All referenced commands exist\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md integration is clear and helpful\n- [ ] Examples are practical and easy to follow\n- [ ] Framework is discoverable (users can find it)\n- [ ] Documentation supports self-service learning\n- [ ] Integration points with existing workflow are clear\n\n**Implementation Note**: This phase completes the framework.
