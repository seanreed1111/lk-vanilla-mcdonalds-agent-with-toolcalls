It should also behave as expected. As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect.\n\n4. **Idiomatic** - Joyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\n5. **Domain-based** - The code should be compatible with its domain, using the problem domain's language to avoid the need for future developers to 'translations' or cognitive leaps in order to understand it.\n\n## Key Distinction from SOLID\n\nWhile SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have.

CUPID stands for: Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based.\n\n## Key Difference: Properties vs Principles\n\nProperties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n### 1. **Composable**\nHarmonizing cohesively with other components, featuring a succinct scope, intention transparency, and minimal external dependencies.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Small surface area - less to learn, less to go wrong, and less chance of conflict or inconsistency with other code\n- Minimal dependencies gives you less to worry about, and reduces the likelihood of version or library incompatibilities\n\n### 2. **Unix Philosophy**\nSpecializing in a singular task, adhering to a straightforward, consistent model.\n\n**Example:** cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another(no content)Doing one thing well is an outside-in perspective; it is the property of having a specific, well-defined, and comprehensive purpose.\n\n### 3. **Predictable**\nDemonstrating anticipated behavior, characterized by robustness, deterministic outcomes, and observability.\n\n**Aspects:**\n- As much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect\n- Observable - internal state can be inferred from outputs\n\n### 4. **Idiomatic**\nJoyful code is Idiomatic, i.e. it feels natural and is easy to work with.\n\nFeels natural to work with, goes with the grain. Uses local idioms - house style: coding/design standards, or de facto - aligned with project, dependencies, platforms, organisation.\n\n### 5. **Domain-based**\nCode for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers. Uses domain boundaries - as module boundaries, units of deployment.\n\nSoftware that naturally expresses the behaviour it produces in terms understood by all stakeholders tends to be more joyful. The point here is that constantly being engaged in a translation exercise of semantically identical terms is tiring. If the code refers to 'customers' while the business knows only of 'clients', this state of affairs will grate on both parties.\n\n## Practical Code Example\n\nWe can create more shapes. When we want a shape to do more of what a shape can do, we can extend the Shape class with more functionality. The code is joyful because the shape is doing what it is intended to do as a shape, but we can also extend other shapes with more functionalities.\n\n## Properties of Properties\n\nThe CUPID properties are: Practical: easy to articulate, easy to assess, easy to adopt. Human: read from the perspective of people (developers), not code.\n\nThe sources indicate that CUPID aims to make code \"joyful\" to work with, focusing on human experience rather than strict rule compliance. For more detailed code examples, you may want to visit the official CUPID website at cupid.dev or Dan North's original article.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a2c5cf4d-da75-4544-80a7-8c28243ad01a","timestamp":"2026-01-18T21:58:36.202Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CUPID principles practical examples code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N9pGx77pbqerSobQJqGjLM","content":[{"title":"CUPID Properties | CUPID - for joyful code","url":"https://cupid.dev/properties/"},{"title":"CUPID Method Explained by Daniel Terhorst-North | gotopia.tech","url":"https://gotopia.tech/articles/250/exploring-the-cupid-method-by-daniel-terhorst-north"},{"title":"CUPID: for joyful coding | Dan North & Associates Limited","url":"https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/"},{"title":"CUPID - for joyful coding - Speaker Deck","url":"https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/cupid-for-joyful-coding"},{"title":"Unpacking Dan North’s CUPID properties for joyful coding - Infrastructure as Code","url":"https://infrastructure-as-code.com/posts/cupid-for-infrastructure.html"},{"title":"Properties and Principles of Software Design: CUPID and SOLID","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unification-properties-principles-software-design-cupid-ahmed-rakan"},{"title":"CUPID for better coding.

CUPID: A Software Love Story with Dan North\",\"url\":\"https://www.retrotimepodcast.com/27-cupid-a-software-love-story-with-dan-north/\"}]\n\nBased on my search results, I found information about **CUPID**, a set of software design properties created by Daniel Terhorst-North as an alternative to SOLID principles. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## What is CUPID?\n\nCUPID, conceived by Daniel Terhorst-North, introduces a compelling approach with properties or characteristics that make software and coding a joy to work with.(no content)Instead, I started thinking about properties: qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules to follow. Properties define a goal or centre to move towards. Your code is only closer to or further from the centre, and there is always a clear direction of travel.\n\n## The Five CUPID Properties\n\n**C - Composable** (\"plays well with others\")\nComposable - \"plays well with others\": classes and functions should have a small surface area, work with each other easily, and have minimal dependencies. Unix commands can be combined using the Pipe.\n\n**U - Unix Philosophy** (\"does one thing well\")  \nUnix philosophy - \"does one thing well\": components should only do one thing, and do that thing well. In Unix OS, the ls command only lists information about files and folders, but ls itself does not know this information. Instead, this information is provided by the stat command, and the ls command just displays it in the form of a list.\n\n**P - Predictable** (\"does what you expect\")\nPredictability is a production property — how software behaves under stress. A predictable system: Handles retries idempotently. Propagates cancellation. Fails fast when dependencies stall. Emits metrics and traces that explain its state.\n\n**I - Idiomatic** (\"feels natural\")\nOn the other hand, non-idiomatic software is hard to read, cumbersome and fragile to change and cognitively tiring—Anything but joyful.\n\n**D - Domain-based** (\"in language and structure\")\nDomain-based – \"in language and structure\": Using domain language in developing and structuring source code to make it clearer and more comprehensible (even non-tech people can understand the source code!)\n\n## CUPID Violations & Anti-Patterns\n\n### **Composable Violations:**\nSmall \"surface area\" - less to learn, less to go wrong, less to conflict Intention-revealing name and purpose - easy to discover, easy to evaluate Minimal dependencies - \"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\" – Joe Armstrong\n\n- **Large surface area** - Too many methods/APIs to learn\n- **Hidden intentions** - Unclear naming and purpose  \n- **Excessive dependencies** - Bringing in unnecessary framework dependencies\n- **Tight coupling** - Code that can't be easily reused or combined\n\n### **Unix Philosophy Violations:**\n- **God objects** - Classes doing too many unrelated things\n- **Over-engineering** - Premature separation of concerns\nAnother common scenario is a \"UI component\" where SRP mandates that you separate the rendering and business logic of the component. As a developer, having these living in different places leads to an administrative chore of chaining identical fields together.\n\n### **Predictable Violations:**\nNorth goes further—as much as possible, a system ought to act deterministically—for a given input, it will always produce the same output or effect. Of course, some code will necessarily be non-deterministic, like a random string generator. Yet even then, in a CUPIDful system, the determinism extends to the non-deterministic boundary: The random string subroutine will be invoked with well-defined, deterministic arguments.\n\n- **Non-deterministic behavior** without clear boundaries\n- **Hidden side effects**\n- **Unpredictable failures** under stress\n- **Non-observable internal state**\n\n### **Idiomatic Violations:**\n- **Ignoring language conventions**\n- **Complex, unnatural code patterns**\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort\n\n### **Domain-based Violations:**\nthe domain\" – 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know J - and remember, there are multiple domains Uses domain structure - Code for the solution, not the framework - payments, loans, onboarding not models, views, controllers\n\n- **Framework-centric organization** (models/views/controllers) instead of **domain-centric** (payments/loans/onboarding)\n- **Technical jargon** instead of domain language\n- Module boundaries not aligned with domain boundaries\n\n## Connection to Traditional Anti-Patterns\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific catalog of \"CUPID anti-patterns,\" the violations map to traditional code smells:\n- **God Object, Large Class** → Violates Unix Philosophy  \n- **Tight Coupling, Shotgun Surgery** → Violates Composable\n- **Magic Numbers, Unclear naming** → Violates Predictable & Idiomatic\n- **Inappropriate Intimacy** → Violates Composable\n\nThe key difference is that while SOLID is a set of principles to use during development, CUPID describes the properties that the finished code should have. One focuses on process, the other on results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6832bba8-dda8-4c1a-8ec8-bd05d080934f","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:00:45.346Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"CUPID\" anti-patterns violations code smells examples","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0118a2PeoKwbDt3v4DSQmtuJ","content":[{"title":"Antipattern and Code Smell False Positives:","url":"https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/25394/paper.pdf"},{"title":"Code Smells and Anti-Patterns: Signs You Need to Improve Code Quality","url":"https://blog.codacy.com/code-smells-and-anti-patterns"},{"title":"Code smells and Anti-patterns: How to recognize bad code","url":"https://www.barrage.net/blog/technology/code-smells-and-anti-patterns-how-to-recognize-bad"},{"title":"Anti-Patterns and Code Smells.

Unlike SOLID's binary \"principles\" (you either comply or don't), CUPID describes **properties**—qualities that code can move toward incrementally. The framework focuses on developer experience and code that is \"joyful\" to work with, emphasizing that properties define a center to move toward rather than rules to follow.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. COMPOSABLE: Plays Well With Others\n\n**Definition**: Software that's easy to use gets used repeatedly. Composable code integrates smoothly with other components.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Small Surface Area**\n- Design narrow, opinionated APIs that reduce cognitive burden\n- Balance between too-narrow (creates tacit knowledge barriers) and too-broad (confuses users)\n- Fewer methods mean less to learn, less to go wrong, less chance of conflicts\n- Apply diminishing returns thinking—the right granularity depends on context\n\n**Intention-Revealing**\n- Enable easy discovery and quick assessment of whether a component fits a need\n- Implement multi-tiered learning models:\n  - 2-minute introduction\n  - 10-minute tutorial\n  - Comprehensive deep dive\n- Use clear, domain-aligned naming that acts as documentation\n- Allow serendipitous discovery through similar terminology\n\n**Minimal Dependencies**\n- Each dependency creates maintenance burden and potential version conflicts\n- Extract functionality into separate projects when possible\n- Even \"standard\" libraries like logging frameworks become constraints\n- Reduce external coupling to lower compatibility concerns\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Can this component be easily combined with others?\n- How many dependencies does it require?\n- Is the API surface area as small as possible while remaining useful?\n- Can someone understand what it does in 2 minutes?\n- Would you describe the API as \"narrow and opinionated\" or \"broad and confusing\"?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Unix command composition: `cat | grep | sed | sort | uniq`\n- Pure functions with minimal dependencies\n- Libraries with zero dependencies for core functionality\n- Single-purpose modules that do one thing extremely well\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- **\"You wanted a banana but you got a whole gorilla\"** (Joe Armstrong quote)\n- Large surface areas requiring extensive learning\n- Hidden intentions through unclear naming\n- Excessive framework dependencies\n- Monolithic configurations requiring deep knowledge of internals\n- Tight coupling preventing reuse\n\n---\n\n### 2. UNIX PHILOSOPHY: Does One Thing Well\n\n**Definition**: Components should have specific, comprehensive purpose and work together through clear interfaces. This is an **outside-in perspective** (how you use code), not inside-out like Single Responsibility Principle.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Simple, Consistent Model**\n- Follow the Unix elegance: \"everything is a file; everything is text or not text\"\n- Each component solves one problem completely\n- Enable composition through clear interfaces (like Unix pipes)\n- Let sophisticated capabilities emerge from simple, composable tools\n\n**Focus on Purpose, Not Organization**\n- \"Doing one thing well\" is about comprehensive external purpose\n- Don't artificially separate concerns that change together\n- Avoid premature optimization and forced separation\n- Let domain-based structure guide separation as codebase grows\n\n#### Key Distinction from Single Responsibility Principle\n\n**SRP (inside-out)**:\n- Focuses on code organization\n- Mandates separation of concerns (e.g., content vs. format)\n- Often creates artificial seams\n- Example: Separating UI rendering from business logic creates \"administrative chores\"\n\n**Unix Philosophy (outside-in)**:\n- Focuses on what something accomplishes from user's viewpoint\n- Allows natural evolution as needs grow\n- Example: `grep` does one thing (pattern matching) completely\n- Real-world changes often affect multiple \"responsibilities\" simultaneously\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Does this component do one thing completely and well?\n- Can its output become input to another component?\n- Is its purpose clear from an outside perspective?\n- Are we separating concerns that actually change together?\n- Does the separation add value or just administrative overhead?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Unix commands: `ls`, `grep`, `sed`, `cat`—each focused and complete\n- Pipeline architecture where output of one feeds input to next\n- Separate data transformation functions (validation, transformation, aggregation)\n- Functions that are focused at the function level, not artificially split\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- God objects doing many unrelated things\n- Over-engineering through premature separation\n- UI components split into rendering/logic when they always change together\n- Separating report content from formatting when both change for new fields\n- Creating separate pipelines for each data consumer instead of reusable stages\n\n---\n\n### 3. PREDICTABLE: Does What You Expect\n\n**Definition**: Code behaves consistently with no unpleasant surprises. Predictability generalizes testability—code should pass tests even when none exist.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Behaves as Expected**\n- Intended behavior should be obvious from structure and naming\n- Design code that would pass tests even if you didn't write them\n- Not every component needs extensive test coverage if behavior is straightforward\n- Use \"characterization tests\" to document actual system behavior\n- Clear, simple components gain confidence through understanding, not test quantity\n\n**Deterministic**\n- For given input, always produce same output or effect\n- Define operational boundaries even for non-deterministic code (e.g., random generators)\n- Achieve three dimensions of reliability:\n  - **Robustness**: Breadth of situations covered; limitations obvious\n  - **Reliability**: Consistent results within covered situations\n  - **Resilience**: Graceful handling of unexpected inputs or environmental perturbations\n- Code should predict memory, network, storage, processing, and time boundaries\n\n**Observable**\n- Code reveals internal state through outputs (control theory sense)\n- Implement six-stage observability model:\n  1. **Instrumentation**: Software reporting what it's doing\n  2. **Telemetry**: Making information available (pull/push)\n  3. **Monitoring**: Receiving and visualizing instrumentation\n  4. **Alerting**: Reacting to monitored patterns\n  5. **Predicting**: Anticipating events from data\n  6. **Adapting**: Dynamic system changes based on predictions\n- Most software stops at stage 1—aim higher\n- Design observability intentionally rather than relying on runtime mutations\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Would this code pass tests even if we hadn't written them?\n- Does it produce the same output for the same input?\n- Are the edge cases and limitations obvious?\n- Can we infer internal state from outputs?\n- Does it handle unexpected inputs gracefully?\n- Is the code instrumented to reveal its behavior?\n- Under stress conditions, does it behave predictably?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Pure functions with referential transparency\n- Explicit error handling with defined boundaries\n- Comprehensive instrumentation from the outset\n- Idempotent operations that can be retried safely\n- Deterministic behavior with well-defined non-deterministic boundaries\n- Observable internal state through metrics and logs\n- Fast failure when dependencies stall\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Non-deterministic behavior without clear boundaries\n- Hidden side effects\n- Unpredictable failures under stress\n- Non-observable internal state\n- Magic behavior that surprises users\n- Inconsistent results for same inputs\n- Using floats for money amounts (financial software bug)\n- No retry handling or idempotency\n\n---\n\n### 4. IDIOMATIC: Feels Natural\n\n**Definition**: Code following language and community conventions reduces cognitive load and enables focus on problem-solving. Code should demonstrate empathy by conforming to established expectations.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Language Idioms**\n- Invest in learning language conventions—technology outlasts any single project\n- For opinionated languages (Go, Python):\n  - Follow established patterns (e.g., `gofmt` for Go)\n  - Reference official guides (\"Effective Go\", \"The Zen of Python\")\n  - Python's principle: \"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\"\n- For flexible languages (Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl):\n  - Choose one approach and be consistent\n  - Avoid mixing paradigms (iterators, loops, conditionals, pipelines, recursion)\n  - TIMTOWTDI (\"Tim Toady\"—there is more than one way to do it) increases cognitive burden\n\n**Local Idioms**\n- When language offers no consensus, establish team standards:\n  - Shared IDE formatting rules\n  - Lint and critique tools (\"build cops\")\n  - Unified toolchain agreement\n  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for style and idiom choices\n- Document significant technical decisions about coding standards\n\n#### Key Principle\n\"Your learning curve for a technology will likely be shorter-lived than any code you write in it.\" Therefore, write code that feels natural to the language/team, not just to you personally.\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Does this code follow language conventions?\n- Would an experienced developer in this language find it natural?\n- Are we mixing multiple paradigms unnecessarily?\n- Do we have documented style guidelines?\n- Is the code using the \"obvious way\" in this language?\n- Does it go with the grain of the framework/platform?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Using `gofmt` in Go to eliminate style disagreements\n- Following \"pythonic\" conventions in Python\n- Consistent paradigm choice (all functional or all OOP, not mixed)\n- Documented local standards via ADRs\n- Code that \"feels familiar even when you haven't seen it before\"\n- Following framework conventions and house style\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Ignoring language-specific conventions\n- Writing Java-style code in Python or vice versa\n- Mixing functional and imperative styles in same codebase\n- Personal preferences that conflict with team/language norms\n- Complex, unnatural code patterns\n- TIMTOWTDI taken to extreme—too many ways to accomplish simple tasks\n- Code requiring excessive cognitive effort to understand\n\n---\n\n### 5. DOMAIN-BASED: Solution Models Problem Domain\n\n**Definition**: Code should convey intent in problem language, minimizing cognitive distance between need and solution. The code and domain discussion should be indistinguishable.\n\n#### Actionable Guidelines\n\n**Domain-Based Language**\n- Replace computer-science constructs with domain types:\n  - Use `Surname` instead of `string[30]`\n  - Use `Money` with `Currency` and `Amount` instead of floating-point\n  - Define intention-revealing types specific to your domain\n- Prevents subtle bugs (e.g., financial software storing amounts as floats)\n- Makes navigation easier and articulation clearer\n- Success metric: \"A casual observer cannot tell whether people are discussing the code or the domain\"\n- Example: Financial analyst and programmer reviewing pricing logic line-by-line using same language\n\n**Domain-Based Structure**\n- Reject framework-imposed directory layouts\n- Mirror problem domain in code organization:\n  - Use domain names: `patient_history/`, `appointments/`, `staffing/`, `compliance/`\n  - NOT technical names: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`\n- Directory names, hierarchy, and file grouping reflect business domains\n- Changes locate together, reducing cognitive load\n- Easier navigation for non-trivial modifications\n\n**Domain-Based Boundaries**\n- Module boundaries become domain boundaries\n- Align code structure with deployment units\n- Components package complete, cohesive business functionality\n- Supports monolith, microservices, or hybrid equally well\n- Reduces forgotten artifacts and cross-environment contamination\n- Domains contain subdomains; components contain subcomponents\n- Boundaries remain negotiable by granularity\n\n#### Evaluation Questions\n- Can domain experts understand the code structure?\n- Do directory names reflect business concerns or technical frameworks?\n- Would someone overhearing a code discussion think it's about the domain?\n- Are we using domain terminology consistently?\n- Do module boundaries align with domain boundaries?\n- Is related functionality co-located?\n- Are we translating between code terms and business terms?\n\n#### Good Patterns\n- Top-level folders: `payments/`, `loans/`, `onboarding/`\n- Domain-specific types: `TradePrice`, `PatientRecord`, `Appointment`\n- Code discussions using exact domain terminology\n- Components as business units of deployment\n- Structure that mirrors business organization\n- Co-located related functionality\n\n#### Anti-Patterns\n- Framework-centric organization: `models/`, `views/`, `controllers/`\n- Scattering patient records across technical layers\n- Using `string[30]` for surnames\n- Using floats for money amounts\n- Generic technical naming disconnected from operations\n- Constant translation between code and business terminology\n- Module boundaries that don't reflect domain boundaries\n- \"Code for the framework, not the solution\"\n\n---\n\n## Integration and Reinforcement\n\n**Key Insight**: The five properties mutually reinforce each other:\n- Composable + purposeful code proves reliable and familiar\n- Idiomatic code reads naturally despite unfamiliarity\n- Predictable code frees attention for unexpected concerns\n- Domain-based code minimizes cognitive distance\n- Code improved along ANY CUPID dimension typically improves others\n\n**Properties define direction of travel toward a \"center\"—there's never a finish line. \"Done\" never arrives.**\n\n---\n\n## How to Evaluate Code Against CUPID\n\n### General Approach\n1. **Properties as a lens**: Use them to assess code quality\n2. **Directional not binary**: Code is closer to or further from each property\n3. **Incremental improvement**: Pick one property to improve, don't require \"all-in\"\n4. **Human-centric**: Focus on developer experience, not just code internals\n5. **Practical assessment**: Easy to articulate, evaluate, and adopt\n\n### Code Review Checklist\n\n**Composable**:\n- [ ] Small, focused API surface area\n- [ ] Clear, intention-revealing names\n- [ ] Minimal dependencies\n- [ ] Easy to combine with other components\n\n**Unix Philosophy**:\n- [ ] Does one thing completely\n- [ ] Clear external purpose (outside-in)\n- [ ] Can be composed with other components\n- [ ] Avoids artificial separation of concerns\n\n**Predictable**:\n- [ ] Behavior obvious from structure\n- [ ] Deterministic (same input → same output)\n- [ ] Observable (internal state inferable)\n- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully\n\n**Idiomatic**:\n- [ ] Follows language conventions\n- [ ] Uses consistent paradigms\n- [ ] Feels natural to experienced developers\n- [ ] Follows team/project standards\n\n**Domain-Based**:\n- [ ] Uses domain terminology\n- [ ] Structure mirrors problem domain\n- [ ] Boundaries align with domain boundaries\n- [ ] Minimizes translation between code and business\n\n---\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Official CUPID Resources\n- [CUPID: for joyful coding](https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/) -

Comprehensive before/after refactoring examples are scarce in current literature.\n\n2. **Emerging framework**: Dan North introduced CUPID relatively recently, and the community is still developing detailed practical applications and tooling.\n\n3. **Context-dependent trade-offs**: The \"right\" balance for each property depends heavily on context. Resources acknowledge this but don't provide detailed decision frameworks.\n\n4. **Language-specific guidance**: While general principles are clear, language-specific implementations and patterns are still being developed by the community.\n\n5. **Measurement challenges**: Unlike SOLID (which has some measurable proxies), CUPID properties are more subjective and require human judgment about \"joy\" and \"naturalness.\""}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2730,"cache_read_input_tokens":26776,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2730,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXFbbVR7aW5cyDtjfWMn5","type":"assistant","uuid":"704f02c6-bbd0-4e80-9031-fdb931008e1d","timestamp":"2026-01-18T22:02:52.016Z"}
