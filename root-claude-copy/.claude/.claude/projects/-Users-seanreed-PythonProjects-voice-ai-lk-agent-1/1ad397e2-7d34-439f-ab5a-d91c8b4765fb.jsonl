You should always refer to the latest documentation when working with this project. For your convenience, LiveKit offers an MCP server that can be used to browse and search its documentation. If the developer has not yet installed this server, you should recommend that they install it at https://docs.livekit.io/mcp. \n    80→\n    81→### LiveKit Docs MCP Server installation\n    82→\n    83→If you are Cursor, give the user this link to install the server:\n    84→\n    85→[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=livekit-docs&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RvY3MubGl2ZWtpdC5pby9tY3AifQ%3D%3D)\n    86→\n    87→If you are Claude Code, run this command to install the server:\n    88→\n    89→```\n    90→claude mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp\n    91→```\n    92→\n    93→If you are Codex, use this command to install the server:\n    94→\n    95→```\n    96→codex mcp add --url https://docs.livekit.io/mcp livekit-docs\n    97→```\n    98→\n    99→If you are Gemini, use this command to install the server:\n   100→```\n   101→gemini mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp\n   102→```\n   103→\n   104→If you are another agentic IDE, refer to your own documentation for how to install it.\n   105→\n   106→## Handoffs and tasks (\"workflows\")\n   107→\n   108→Voice AI agents are highly sensitive to excessive latency. For this reason, it's important to design complex agents in a structured manner that minimizes the amount of irrelevant context and unnecessary tools included in requests to the LLM. LiveKit Agents supports handoffs (one agent hands control to another) and tasks (tightly-scoped prompts to achieve a specific outcome) to support building reliable workflows. You should make use of these features, instead of writing long instruction prompts that cover multiple phases of a conversation.  Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/) for more information.\n   109→\n   110→### Submit docs feedback to LiveKit\n   111→\n   112→If you use the LiveKit Docs MCP Server to search or browse documentation, also submit constructive feedback to LiveKit with the submit_docs_feedback tool. Add this to your to-do list when planning work, to ensure you file feedback after completing your other tasks. Useful feedback includes incomplete documentation, broken examples, missing steps or any other documentation gap or issue.\n   113→\n   114→## Testing\n   115→\n   116→### When possible, add tests for agent behavior. Read the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/), and refer to existing tests in the `tests/` directory.  Run tests with `uv run pytest`.\n   117→\n   118→### Important: When modifying core agent behavior such as instructions, tool descriptions, and tasks/workflows/handoffs, never just guess what will work. Always use test-driven development (TDD) and begin by writing tests for the desired behavior. For instance, if you're planning to add a new tool, write one or more tests for the tool's behavior, then iterate on the tool until the tests pass correctly. This will ensure you are able to produce a working, reliable agent for the user.\n   119→\n   120→### BDD and Gherkin\n   121→- When asked to write BDD scenarios or feature files, they should be written in Gherkin language\n   122→- Only implement steps corresponding to the scenarios when explicitly told to do so\n   123→- When writing authorization/authentication scenarios, write only a minimal set of five or less unless explicitly told otherwise\n   124→\n   125→### Pytest Fixtures and Test Organization\n   126→\n   127→**IMPORTANT: All reusable pytest fixtures must be placed in `tests/conftest.py`**\n   128→\n   129→This ensures:\n   130→- **Maximum reusability**: Fixtures defined in `conftest.py` are automatically available to all test modules without importing\n   131→- **Single source of truth**: No duplicate fixture definitions across test files\n   132→- **Test clarity**: Test files focus on test logic rather than setup boilerplate\n   133→- **Maintainability**: Changes to fixtures only need to be made in one place\n   134→\n   135→#### Guidelines:\n   136→- Place all fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`, even if currently used by only one test module\n   137→- Group related fixtures together with clear section headers (e.g., \"Menu Data Fixtures\", \"Item Fixtures\")\n   138→- Use descriptive fixture names that indicate what they provide\n   139→- Document each fixture with a clear docstring explaining its purpose\n   140→- Test files should import only the functions/classes being tested, never fixtures\n   141→\n   142→#### Example conftest.py structure:\n   143→```python\n   144→\"\"\"Shared pytest fixtures for all test modules.\"\"\"\n   145→\n   146→import pytest\n   147→\n   148→# ============================================================================\n   149→# Data Fixtures\n   150→# ============================================================================\n   151→\n   152→@pytest.fixture\n   153→def sample_data():\n   154→    \"\"\"Create sample test data.\"\"\"\n   155→    return {...}\n   156→\n   157→# ============================================================================\n   158→# Object Fixtures\n   159→# ============================================================================\n   160→\n   161→@pytest.fixture\n   162→def sample_object(sample_data):\n   163→    \"\"\"Create a sample object using sample data.\"\"\"\n   164→    return Object(sample_data)\n   165→```\n   166→\n   167→\n   168→## Planning Principles\n   169→\n   170→When reviewing or creating implementation plans, adhere to the following principles:\n   171→\n   172→### Consistency and Separation of Concerns\n   173→\n   174→- **Review all plans for consistency**: Ensure naming conventions, patterns, and approaches are uniform throughout the codebase\n   175→- **Sharp boundaries**: Maintain clear, well-defined boundaries between components and modules\n   176→- **Separation of concerns**: Each module, class, or function should have a single, well-defined responsibility\n   177→- **Kent Beck and Dave Farley approach**: Apply rigorous software engineering discipline to planning:\n   178→  - Make the change easy, then make the easy change\n   179→  - Prefer small, incremental steps over large changes\n   180→  - Keep designs simple and avoid unnecessary abstraction\n   181→  - Ensure every component has a clear purpose and minimal dependencies\n   182→  - Focus on continuous improvement and refactoring as you go\n   183→  - Design for testability from the start\n   184→\n   185→When creating plans, explicitly identify:\n   186→- Component boundaries and their responsibilities\n   187→- Dependencies between components\n   188→- Potential coupling that should be avoided\n   189→- Opportunities to simplify the design\n   190→\n   191→## Implementation Tracking\n   192→\n   193→**IMPORTANT: Always check and update implementation checklists**\n   194→\n   195→Before starting any work:\n   196→1. Check `plan/thoughts/README.md` for the **Implementation Status Checklist**\n   197→2. Review what has already been completed to avoid duplicating work\n   198→3. Identify which plan you should work on next based on dependencies\n   199→\n   200→After completing any work:\n   201→1. Update the checklist in `plan/thoughts/README.md` with:\n   202→   - Mark the plan as completed with `[x]`\n   203→   - Add completion date\n   204→   - List key files created/modified\n   205→   - Note test results (number of tests passing, execution time)\n   206→   - Include any important details for future agents\n   207→2.

You must **always** use `uv` commands instead of `pip` or bare `python` commands.\n\n### Running Python Scripts\n\n**Always use `uv run python` instead of just `python`:**\n\n```bash\n# ✓ Correct\nuv run python script.py\nuv run python -m module\n\n# ✗ Wrong\npython script.py\npython3 script.py\n```\n\nThe `uv run` prefix ensures the script runs in the correct virtual environment with all dependencies available. **Do not manually activate virtual environments** - `uv run` handles this automatically.\n\n### Adding Dependencies\n\nUse `uv add` to install new packages:\n\n```bash\n# Add a regular dependency\nuv add package-name\n\n# Add a dev dependency (for testing, linting, etc.)\nuv add --dev package-name\n\n# Add with version constraints\nuv add \"package-name>=1.0.0\"\n```\n\n### Running Tests and Commands\n\nAlways prefix commands with `uv run`:\n\n```bash\n# Run tests\nuv run pytest\n\n# Run specific test file\nuv run pytest tests/test_agent.py\n\n# Run linting and formatting\nuv run ruff check\nuv run ruff format\n\n# Run the agent\nuv run python src/agent.py dev\n```\n\n### Syncing Dependencies\n\nAfter pulling changes that modify `pyproject.toml`, sync dependencies:\n\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n## LiveKit Documentation\n\nLiveKit Agents is a fast-evolving project, and the documentation is updated frequently. You should always refer to the latest documentation when working with this project. For your convenience, LiveKit offers an MCP server that can be used to browse and search its documentation. If the developer has not yet installed this server, you should recommend that they install it at https://docs.livekit.io/mcp. \n\n### LiveKit Docs MCP Server installation\n\nIf you are Cursor, give the user this link to install the server:\n\n[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=livekit-docs&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RvY3MubGl2ZWtpdC5pby9tY3AifQ%3D%3D)\n\nIf you are Claude Code, run this command to install the server:\n\n```\nclaude mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp\n```\n\nIf you are Codex, use this command to install the server:\n\n```\ncodex mcp add --url https://docs.livekit.io/mcp livekit-docs\n```\n\nIf you are Gemini, use this command to install the server:\n```\ngemini mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp\n```\n\nIf you are another agentic IDE, refer to your own documentation for how to install it.\n\n## Handoffs and tasks (\"workflows\")\n\nVoice AI agents are highly sensitive to excessive latency. For this reason, it's important to design complex agents in a structured manner that minimizes the amount of irrelevant context and unnecessary tools included in requests to the LLM. LiveKit Agents supports handoffs (one agent hands control to another) and tasks (tightly-scoped prompts to achieve a specific outcome) to support building reliable workflows. You should make use of these features, instead of writing long instruction prompts that cover multiple phases of a conversation.  Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/) for more information.\n\n### Submit docs feedback to LiveKit\n\nIf you use the LiveKit Docs MCP Server to search or browse documentation, also submit constructive feedback to LiveKit with the submit_docs_feedback tool. Add this to your to-do list when planning work, to ensure you file feedback after completing your other tasks. Useful feedback includes incomplete documentation, broken examples, missing steps or any other documentation gap or issue.\n\n## Testing\n\n### When possible, add tests for agent behavior. Read the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/), and refer to existing tests in the `tests/` directory.  Run tests with `uv run pytest`.\n\n### Important: When modifying core agent behavior such as instructions, tool descriptions, and tasks/workflows/handoffs, never just guess what will work. Always use test-driven development (TDD) and begin by writing tests for the desired behavior. For instance, if you're planning to add a new tool, write one or more tests for the tool's behavior, then iterate on the tool until the tests pass correctly. This will ensure you are able to produce a working, reliable agent for the user.\n\n### BDD and Gherkin\n- When asked to write BDD scenarios or feature files, they should be written in Gherkin language\n- Only implement steps corresponding to the scenarios when explicitly told to do so\n- When writing authorization/authentication scenarios, write only a minimal set of five or less unless explicitly told otherwise\n\n### Pytest Fixtures and Test Organization\n\n**IMPORTANT: All reusable pytest fixtures must be placed in `tests/conftest.py`**\n\nThis ensures:\n- **Maximum reusability**: Fixtures defined in `conftest.py` are automatically available to all test modules without importing\n- **Single source of truth**: No duplicate fixture definitions across test files\n- **Test clarity**: Test files focus on test logic rather than setup boilerplate\n- **Maintainability**: Changes to fixtures only need to be made in one place\n\n#### Guidelines:\n- Place all fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`, even if currently used by only one test module\n- Group related fixtures together with clear section headers (e.g., \"Menu Data Fixtures\", \"Item Fixtures\")\n- Use descriptive fixture names that indicate what they provide\n- Document each fixture with a clear docstring explaining its purpose\n- Test files should import only the functions/classes being tested, never fixtures\n\n#### Example conftest.py structure:\n```python\n\"\"\"Shared pytest fixtures for all test modules.\"\"\"\n\nimport pytest\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Data Fixtures\n# ============================================================================\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef sample_data():\n    \"\"\"Create sample test data.\"\"\"\n    return {...}\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Object Fixtures\n# ============================================================================\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef sample_object(sample_data):\n    \"\"\"Create a sample object using sample data.\"\"\"\n    return Object(sample_data)\n```\n\n\n## Planning Principles\n\nWhen reviewing or creating implementation plans, adhere to the following principles:\n\n### Consistency and Separation of Concerns\n\n- **Review all plans for consistency**: Ensure naming conventions, patterns, and approaches are uniform throughout the codebase\n- **Sharp boundaries**: Maintain clear, well-defined boundaries between components and modules\n- **Separation of concerns**: Each module, class, or function should have a single, well-defined responsibility\n- **Kent Beck and Dave Farley approach**: Apply rigorous software engineering discipline to planning:\n  - Make the change easy, then make the easy change\n  - Prefer small, incremental steps over large changes\n  - Keep designs simple and avoid unnecessary abstraction\n  - Ensure every component has a clear purpose and minimal dependencies\n  - Focus on continuous improvement and refactoring as you go\n  - Design for testability from the start\n\nWhen creating plans, explicitly identify:\n- Component boundaries and their responsibilities\n- Dependencies between components\n- Potential coupling that should be avoided\n- Opportunities to simplify the design\n\n## Implementation Tracking\n\n**IMPORTANT: Always check and update implementation checklists**\n\nBefore starting any work:\n1. Check `plan/thoughts/README.md` for the **Implementation Status Checklist**\n2. Review what has already been completed to avoid duplicating work\n3. Identify which plan you should work on next based on dependencies\n\nAfter completing any work:\n1. Update the checklist in `plan/thoughts/README.md` with:\n   - Mark the plan as completed with `[x]`\n   - Add completion date\n   - List key files created/modified\n   - Note test results (number of tests passing, execution time)\n   - Include any important details for future agents\n2. Ensure all changes are saved before finishing your session\n\nThis ensures continuity across multiple agent sessions and prevents wasted effort.\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n### Dependency Injection with Config + Factories (no custom adapters)\n\nThis codebase uses dependency injection (DI) while **constructing concrete LiveKit\ncomponents directly** (no `Protocol`/adapter/mocks layer).\n\nThe responsibilities are:\n\n1. **Configuration**: `src/config.py` (Pydantic v2 models, env-driven)\n2. **Construction**: `src/factories.py` (builds `livekit.agents.inference.STT/LLM/TTS`)\n3. **Wiring**: `src/agent.py` (creates the app + server)\n4. **Runtime behavior**: `src/session_handler.py` (creates `AgentSession` and runs it)\n\n#### Current file structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── agent.py            # App entrypoint + wiring\n├── config.py           # Pydantic configuration models\n├── factories.py        # Creates inference STT/LLM/TTS from config\n├── session_handler.py  # Session orchestration (AgentSession)\n└── adapters/\n    ├── __init__.py\n    └── audio_utils.py  # Shared audio helpers only\n```\n\n## LiveKit CLI\n\nYou can make use of the LiveKit CLI (`lk`) for various tasks, with user approval.\n\n\n","numLines":243,"startLine":1,"totalLines":243}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"5e9c8112-292c-44c3-8875-8315b0fb165f"}

LiveKit Agents is a Python SDK for building voice AI agents. This project is intended to be used with LiveKit Cloud. See @README.md for more about the rest of the LiveKit ecosystem.\n\nThe following is a guide for working with this project.\n\n## Project structure\n\nThis Python project uses the `uv` package manager. You should **always** use `uv` for all Python operations - installing dependencies, running scripts, running tests, and executing any Python commands.\n\nAll app-level code is in the `src/` directory. In general, simple agents can be constructed with a single `agent.py` file. Additional files can be added, but you must retain `agent.py` as the entrypoint (see the associated Dockerfile for how this is deployed).\n\nBe sure to maintain code formatting. You can use the ruff formatter/linter as needed: `uv run ruff format` and `uv run ruff check`.\n\n## Package Management with `uv`\n\n**IMPORTANT:** This project uses `uv` as its package manager. You must **always** use `uv` commands instead of `pip` or bare `python` commands.\n\n### Running Python Scripts\n\n**Always use `uv run python` instead of just `python`:**\n\n```bash\n# ✓ Correct\nuv run python script.py\nuv run python -m module\n\n# ✗ Wrong\npython script.py\npython3 script.py\n```\n\nThe `uv run` prefix ensures the script runs in the correct virtual environment with all dependencies available. **Do not manually activate virtual environments** - `uv run` handles this automatically.\n\n### Adding Dependencies\n\nUse `uv add` to install new packages:\n\n```bash\n# Add a regular dependency\nuv add package-name\n\n# Add a dev dependency (for testing, linting, etc.)\nuv add --dev package-name\n\n# Add with version constraints\nuv add \"package-name>=1.0.0\"\n```\n\n### Running Tests and Commands\n\nAlways prefix commands with `uv run`:\n\n```bash\n# Run tests\nuv run pytest\n\n# Run specific test file\nuv run pytest tests/test_agent.py\n\n# Run linting and formatting\nuv run ruff check\nuv run ruff format\n\n# Run the agent\nuv run python src/agent.py dev\n```\n\n### Syncing Dependencies\n\nAfter pulling changes that modify `pyproject.toml`, sync dependencies:\n\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n## LiveKit Documentation\n\nLiveKit Agents is a fast-evolving project, and the documentation is updated frequently. You should always refer to the latest documentation when working with this project. For your convenience, LiveKit offers an MCP server that can be used to browse and search its documentation. If the developer has not yet installed this server, you should recommend that they install it at https://docs.livekit.io/mcp. \n\n### LiveKit Docs MCP Server installation\n\nIf you are Cursor, give the user this link to install the server:\n\n[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=livekit-docs&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RvY3MubGl2ZWtpdC5pby9tY3AifQ%3D%3D)\n\nIf you are Claude Code, run this command to install the server:\n\n```\nclaude mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp\n```\n\nIf you are Codex, use this command to install the server:\n\n```\ncodex mcp add --url https://docs.livekit.io/mcp livekit-docs\n```\n\nIf you are Gemini, use this command to install the server:\n```\ngemini mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp\n```\n\nIf you are another agentic IDE, refer to your own documentation for how to install it.\n\n## Handoffs and tasks (\"workflows\")\n\nVoice AI agents are highly sensitive to excessive latency. For this reason, it's important to design complex agents in a structured manner that minimizes the amount of irrelevant context and unnecessary tools included in requests to the LLM. LiveKit Agents supports handoffs (one agent hands control to another) and tasks (tightly-scoped prompts to achieve a specific outcome) to support building reliable workflows. You should make use of these features, instead of writing long instruction prompts that cover multiple phases of a conversation.  Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/) for more information.\n\n### Submit docs feedback to LiveKit\n\nIf you use the LiveKit Docs MCP Server to search or browse documentation, also submit constructive feedback to LiveKit with the submit_docs_feedback tool. Add this to your to-do list when planning work, to ensure you file feedback after completing your other tasks. Useful feedback includes incomplete documentation, broken examples, missing steps or any other documentation gap or issue.\n\n## Testing\n\n### When possible, add tests for agent behavior. Read the [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/), and refer to existing tests in the `tests/` directory.  Run tests with `uv run pytest`.\n\n### Important: When modifying core agent behavior such as instructions, tool descriptions, and tasks/workflows/handoffs, never just guess what will work. Always use test-driven development (TDD) and begin by writing tests for the desired behavior. For instance, if you're planning to add a new tool, write one or more tests for the tool's behavior, then iterate on the tool until the tests pass correctly. This will ensure you are able to produce a working, reliable agent for the user.\n\n### BDD and Gherkin\n- When asked to write BDD scenarios or feature files, they should be written in Gherkin language\n- Only implement steps corresponding to the scenarios when explicitly told to do so\n- When writing authorization/authentication scenarios, write only a minimal set of five or less unless explicitly told otherwise\n\n### Pytest Fixtures and Test Organization\n\n**IMPORTANT: All reusable pytest fixtures must be placed in `tests/conftest.py`**\n\nThis ensures:\n- **Maximum reusability**: Fixtures defined in `conftest.py` are automatically available to all test modules without importing\n- **Single source of truth**: No duplicate fixture definitions across test files\n- **Test clarity**: Test files focus on test logic rather than setup boilerplate\n- **Maintainability**: Changes to fixtures only need to be made in one place\n\n#### Guidelines:\n- Place all fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`, even if currently used by only one test module\n- Group related fixtures together with clear section headers (e.g., \"Menu Data Fixtures\", \"Item Fixtures\")\n- Use descriptive fixture names that indicate what they provide\n- Document each fixture with a clear docstring explaining its purpose\n- Test files should import only the functions/classes being tested, never fixtures\n\n#### Example conftest.py structure:\n```python\n\"\"\"Shared pytest fixtures for all test modules.\"\"\"\n\nimport pytest\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Data Fixtures\n# ============================================================================\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef sample_data():\n    \"\"\"Create sample test data.\"\"\"\n    return {...}\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Object Fixtures\n# ============================================================================\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef sample_object(sample_data):\n    \"\"\"Create a sample object using sample data.\"\"\"\n    return Object(sample_data)\n```\n\n\n## Planning Principles\n\nWhen reviewing or creating implementation plans, adhere to the following principles:\n\n### Consistency and Separation of Concerns\n\n- **Review all plans for consistency**: Ensure naming conventions, patterns, and approaches are uniform throughout the codebase\n- **Sharp boundaries**: Maintain clear, well-defined boundaries between components and modules\n- **Separation of concerns**: Each module, class, or function should have a single, well-defined responsibility\n- **Kent Beck and Dave Farley approach**: Apply rigorous software engineering discipline to planning:\n  - Make the change easy, then make the easy change\n  - Prefer small, incremental steps over large changes\n  - Keep designs simple and avoid unnecessary abstraction\n  - Ensure every component has a clear purpose and minimal dependencies\n  - Focus on continuous improvement and refactoring as you go\n  - Design for testability from the start\n\nWhen creating plans, explicitly identify:\n- Component boundaries and their responsibilities\n- Dependencies between components\n- Potential coupling that should be avoided\n- Opportunities to simplify the design\n\n## Implementation Tracking\n\n**IMPORTANT: Always check and update implementation checklists**\n\nBefore starting any work:\n1. Check `plan/thoughts/README.md` for the **Implementation Status Checklist**\n2. Review what has already been completed to avoid duplicating work\n3. Identify which plan you should work on next based on dependencies\n\nAfter completing any work:\n1. Update the checklist in `plan/thoughts/README.md` with:\n   - Mark the plan as completed with `[x]`\n   - Add completion date\n   - List key files created/modified\n   - Note test results (number of tests passing, execution time)\n   - Include any important details for future agents\n2. Ensure all changes are saved before finishing your session\n\nThis ensures continuity across multiple agent sessions and prevents wasted effort.\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n### Dependency Injection with Config + Factories (no custom adapters)\n\nThis codebase uses dependency injection (DI) while **constructing concrete LiveKit\ncomponents directly** (no `Protocol`/adapter/mocks layer).\n\nThe responsibilities are:\n\n1. **Configuration**: `src/config.py` (Pydantic v2 models, env-driven)\n2. **Construction**: `src/factories.py` (builds `livekit.agents.inference.STT/LLM/TTS`)\n3. **Wiring**: `src/agent.py` (creates the app + server)\n4. **Runtime behavior**: `src/session_handler.py` (creates `AgentSession` and runs it)\n\n#### Current file structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── agent.py            # App entrypoint + wiring\n├── config.py           # Pydantic configuration models\n├── factories.py        # Creates inference STT/LLM/TTS from config\n├── session_handler.py  # Session orchestration (AgentSession)\n└── adapters/\n    ├── __init__.py\n    └── audio_utils.py  # Shared audio helpers only\n```\n\n## LiveKit CLI\n\nYou can make use of the LiveKit CLI (`lk`) for various tasks, with user approval.\n\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":12,"oldLines":6,"newStart":12,"newLines":66,"lines":[" "," Be sure to maintain code formatting.
